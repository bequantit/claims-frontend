Insuring Agreement Analysis\n\nThe **Insurer**'s insuring agreements, as stated in the **Policy**, are as follows `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section I]`:\n\n> A. The Insurer will pay on behalf of the Insured Persons, Loss in excess of the applicable Retention resulting from Claims first made during the Policy Period against the Insured Persons for which the Insured Persons are legally obligated to pay for Wrongful Acts, except for Loss which the Company pays as indemnification.\n> \n> B. The Insurer will pay on behalf of the Company, Loss in excess of the applicable Retention resulting from Claims first made during the Policy Period against the Insured Persons for which the Company has agreed to or is legally permitted or required by law to indemnify the Insured Persons for Wrongful Acts.\n\n#### The definition of \"Claim\"\n\nThe submitted Complaint satisfies the **Policy**'s definition of a **Claim**.\n\nThe **Policy**, as amended by Endorsement 3660, defines **Claim** as `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause B]`:\n\n> ...any of the following instituted against an **Insured Person** or against the **Company**: (1) a written or oral demand for monetary damages or non-monetary relief; (2) a civil proceeding commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading; (3) a criminal proceeding commenced by a return of an indictment; (4) an arbitration or mediation proceeding in which monetary damages are sought; (5) a formal administrative or regulatory proceeding commenced by the filing of a notice of charges, formal investigative order or similar document; or (6) a written request to toll or waive a statute of limitations, relating to a potential **Claim** described in Items (1) through (5) above, for a **Wrongful Act** including any appeal from such proceeding.\n\nThe document submitted is a civil complaint filed in the State of Rhode Island Superior Court `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. This falls squarely within prong (2) of the definition of **Claim**, as it is a civil proceeding commenced by the service of a complaint. `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause B]`. It also constitutes a written demand for monetary damages under prong (1) `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Number 1]`. Thus, the Complaint constitutes a **Claim** under the **Policy**.\n\n#### Insured Status of Named Parties\n\nThe named defendants in the Complaint partially qualify as **Insured Persons** under the **Policy**.\n\nThe named **Insured** entity is Bancorp Rhode Island, Inc. and its various subsidiaries, including Bank Rhode Island (BankRI) `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 1]`. The defendants named in the Complaint are Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. d/b/a BankRI, Bernard LaBush, and Stevan H. LaBush `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The Complaint also contains allegations concerning the conduct of Laurie Bruyere, an Assistant Vice President and Branch Manager for BankRI `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 10]`. Although not a named defendant, her actions as an employee could impute liability to the **Company**.\n\nThe **Policy**, as amended by Endorsement 3660, defines an **Insured Person** as `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause E]`:\n\n> ...any past, present or future director, trustee, officer, **Employee** or honorary and/or advisory director or trustee of the **Company**.\n\nThe definition of **Employee** includes `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III]`:\n\n> ...any natural person who is a past, present or future employee of the **Company** including any part-time, seasonal or temporary employee, acting in their capacity as such.\n\n*   **Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. d/b/a BankRI**: Is the first named entity in Item 1 of the Declarations and thus qualifies as the **Company** `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 1]` `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section III, Clause C]`.\n*   **Laurie Bruyere**: The Complaint identifies Ms. Bruyere as an Assistant Vice President and Branch Manager for BankRI `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 10]`. As an officer and **Employee** of the **Company**, she would qualify as an **Insured Person** `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause E]`.\n*   **Bernard LaBush and Stevan H. LaBush**: These individuals are identified as accountants retained by the plaintiffs and doing business as LaBush and Company `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]` `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 6-7]`. They are not alleged to be directors, officers, or employees of the **Company**. They do not meet the definition of **Insured Person**, and no coverage is afforded for the **Claims** asserted against them.\n\n#### Wrongful Act\n\nThe Complaint alleges **Wrongful Acts** against an **Insured**.\n\nThe **Policy** defines **Wrongful Act** as `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause L]`:\n\n> ...any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty by: (1) any **Insured Person** acting solely in the capacity as such...\n\nThe Complaint alleges, inter alia, that BankRI, through its **Employee** Laurie Bruyere, engaged in mismanagement, breached its duties to the plaintiffs by failing to use due care in handling EMC's accounts, and negligently permitted an unauthorized individual to borrow from a line of credit `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]` `[claim.pdf, Page 11, Number 52]` `[claim.pdf, Page 13, Number 71]`. These allegations of neglect, error, omission, and breach of duty fall within the definition of a **Wrongful Act** as defined by the **Policy**.\n\n#### Claims Made and Reported Analysis\n\nThe **Claim** was first made during the **Policy Period** and timely reported.\n\nFor avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage.\n\nThe **Policy Period** is from 12:01 A.M. on 06/01/2005 to 12:01 A.M. on 06/01/2008 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 2]`. The Complaint is dated May 2008, and the **Claim** was made on 05/05/2008, which is within the **Policy Period**. The **Claim** was reported to the **Insurer** on 05/07/2008. The **Policy**, as amended by Endorsement 4572, requires that written notice of any **Claim** be given as soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the end of the **Policy Year** in which the **Claim** is made `[policy.pdf, Page 60, Section A]`. The reporting on 05/07/2008 satisfies this requirement.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe matter constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against an **Insured Person** and the **Company**, which was first made during the **Policy Period** and timely reported. Therefore, the **Claim** triggers the **Policy**'s Insuring Agreements, subject to all other terms, conditions, and exclusions.\n\n### 2. \"Loss\" Analysis\n\nThe **Policy**, as modified by Endorsement 2245, defines **Loss** as:\n\n> any amount which the **Insured Persons** are legally obligated to pay for a **Claim**, including **Defense Costs**, damages, judgments, settlements, pre- and post-judgment interest, punitive or exemplary damages and the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award where insurable by law... `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause G]`\n\n> The term \"**Loss**\" also includes civil money penalties imposed against **Insured Persons** by a federal or state banking regulatory agency. `[policy.pdf, Page 49, Number 1]`\n\nThe definition of **Loss** explicitly excludes \"criminal or civil fines or penalties imposed by law\", except for certain regulatory penalties `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause G]`, \"taxes\" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause G]`, and \"matters which are uninsurable under the law\" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause G]`.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $2,000,000 `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, declaratory relief concerning a $250,000 debt `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Number 86]`, and costs of the action including reasonable attorney's fees `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Number 4]`. These damages, if awarded, would likely constitute **Loss** under the **Policy**. The request for payment of attorney's fees also falls within the definition of **Loss**, as **Defense Costs** are expressly included.\n\nThe request for declaratory relief that the $250,000 debt is void `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Number 86]` may not constitute **Loss** itself, but rather seeks to prevent a future financial obligation. However, the costs to defend against this count would be covered **Defense Costs**. At this initial stage, the full scope of damages is unclear, and a reservation of rights is appropriate regarding whether all amounts ultimately sought by the plaintiffs will constitute covered **Loss** under the **Policy**.\n\n### 3. Related Claims\n\nThe Complaint does not make explicit reference to any prior litigation, notice, or proceeding that would constitute a **Related Claim** under the **Policy**. The **Policy** states that **Claims** based upon or arising out of the same **Wrongful Act** or **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** shall be considered a single **Claim** and deemed first made on the date the earliest of such **Claims** was first made `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section V, Clause C]`.\n\n### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions\n\n#### Applicable or Potentially Applicable Exclusions\n\n*   **Fraud Exclusion**: This exclusion is applicable, subject to final adjudication. The **Insurer** shall not be liable for **Loss**, other than **Defense Costs**, in connection with a **Claim** arising from a fraudulent, dishonest, or criminal act `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause D]`. The Complaint alleges that the bank's misconduct enabled an \"embezzlement scheme\" `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]` and references \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\" `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Count IX]`, which could involve conduct contemplated by this exclusion. However, the exclusion only applies if a judgment or other final adjudication establishes such an act `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause D]`. Therefore, **Defense Costs** must be advanced until such a final adjudication.\n*   **Illegal Profit Exclusion**: This exclusion is applicable, subject to final adjudication. The **Insurer** shall not be liable for **Loss**, other than **Defense Costs**, in connection with a **Claim** arising from an **Insured Person** gaining any profit, remuneration, or financial advantage to which they were not legally entitled `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause E]`. The Complaint alleges unjust enrichment against BankRI `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Count X]`. This exclusion is conditional upon a judgment or other final adjudication establishing the illegal gain `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause E]`. Therefore, **Defense Costs** must be advanced until such a final adjudication.\n*   **Prior and Pending Litigation Exclusion**: This exclusion is potentially applicable. As modified by Endorsement 4562, the **Insurer** is not liable for **Loss** from any **Claim** arising out of litigation initiated prior to January 17, 1995, or arising from the same facts as such prior litigation `[policy.pdf, Page 59, Section IV, Clause I]`. While the current Complaint does not reference prior litigation, further investigation is warranted to confirm no such prior litigation exists.\n*   **Bodily Injury and Property Damage Exclusion**: This exclusion is partially applicable. The **Insurer** is not liable for **Loss** in connection with a **Claim** for, inter alia, \"mental anguish, emotional distress\" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section IV, Clause A]`. The Complaint includes counts for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Count VIII]` `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Count IX]`. Any **Loss** (other than **Defense Costs**) specifically for these emotional distress damages would be excluded. However, the exclusion contains a carve-out for emotional distress in connection with an employment-related **Claim**, which is not at issue here `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause A]`.\n\n#### Non-Applicable Exclusions\n\n*   **Collusion Exclusion**: Not applicable. This exclusion pertains to claims by security holders `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause B]`.\n*   **ERISA Exclusion**: Not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve pension or employee benefit programs under ERISA `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause C]`.\n*   **Insured vs. Insured Exclusion**: Not applicable. As modified by Endorsement 4562, this exclusion bars claims by or at the behest of the **Company** or an **Insured Person** `[policy.pdf, Page 58, Section IV, Clause F]`. The claimants are third parties `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 3-4]`.\n*   **Pollution Exclusion**: Not applicable. As modified by Endorsement 4562, this exclusion pertains to environmental pollutants and is not relevant to the allegations `[policy.pdf, Page 58, Section IV, Clause G]`.\n*   **Prior Notice Exclusion**: Not applicable. As modified by Endorsement 4562, this exclusion applies if notice of the **Wrongful Act** was given under a prior policy `[policy.pdf, Page 59, Section IV, Clause H]`. There is no indication of such prior notice.\n*   **Short-Swing Profit Exclusion**: Not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section IV, Clause J]`.\n*   **Subsidiary Past Acts Exclusion**: Not applicable. The allegations do not concern acts of a **Subsidiary** prior to its acquisition `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section IV, Clause K]`.\n*   **Trust Operations Exclusion**: Not applicable. This exclusion, added by Endorsement 4475, pertains to Trust Operations of the **Company** `[policy.pdf, Page 52]`. The allegations concern commercial banking and credit line services `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`.\n\n### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions\n\n*   **Allocation Clause**: This clause is relevant. The **Claim** involves allegations against both covered parties (BankRI and its **Employee**) and non-covered parties (Bernard and Stevan LaBush), and alleges both potentially covered causes of action (e.g., negligence) and potentially uncovered damages (e.g., emotional distress). The **Policy** requires the parties to use their best efforts to allocate amounts between covered and uncovered **Loss**, with provisions for arbitration if an agreement cannot be reached `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section IX, Clause B]`.\n*   **Defense and Settlement Clause**: This clause is relevant. The **Insurer** has no duty to defend, but the **Insureds** must obtain the **Insurer**'s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, before incurring **Defense Costs** or settling any **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 46, Section VI, Clause A]`. Counsel must be mutually agreed upon `[policy.pdf, Page 46, Section VI, Clause A]`.\n*   **Other Insurance Clause**: This clause is relevant. The **Policy** provides that its coverage is excess to any other existing insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section IX, Clause J]`.\n*   **Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause**: This clause is not currently relevant, as the named defendants are the **Company** and individuals, and there is no indication that the matter involves an unendorsed acquisition `[policy.pdf, Page 43, Section VIII]`.\n*   **Claim Interrelation/Related Claims Clause**: This clause is relevant. Any **Claims** arising from the same or **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** are considered a single **Claim**, subject to one Retention and Limit of Liability, and are deemed made when the first such **Claim** was made `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section V, Clause C]`.\n# Conclusion\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, there is **potential coverage** for the **Claim** asserted against Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. The Complaint qualifies as a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against an **Insured**, first made during the **Policy Period** and properly reported. Accordingly, a duty to advance **Defense Costs** is triggered, subject to the **Policy**'s terms, including the applicable $100,000 Retention for Insuring Agreement B and the Allocation clause.\n\nThe initial coverage position is to issue a reservation of rights letter. This reservation should be predicated upon several grounds, most notably: (i) the potential applicability of the Fraud and Illegal Profit exclusions pending final adjudication; (ii) the express exclusion for **Loss** stemming from emotional distress claims; (iii) the need to allocate **Defense Costs** and any ultimate **Loss** between covered and uncovered parties (the LaBush defendants) and claims; and (iv) confirmation that no prior notice or litigation triggers the relevant exclusions. The position is preliminary and subject to modification as further factual and legal development of the **Claim** ensues.\n"
