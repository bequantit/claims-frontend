This matter constitutes a claim for damages and injunctive relief, deemed created on 05/01/2013, initiated by the Plaintiff, Sun Well Services, Inc., as successor in interest to Well Services Ltd., and filed in the District Court for the County of Ward, State of North Dakota `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Heading]`. The claim alleges, inter alia, breach of contract, fraud, and civil conspiracy against Robert Mau and Eagle Well Services, Inc., arising from the purported violation of a noncompetition agreement ancillary to an Asset Purchase Agreement `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 2]`.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
The following entities and individuals are named as Defendants in the instant action:
- **Robert Mau:** An individual, identified as a shareholder of Eagle Well Services, Inc. and a party to the subject Asset Purchase Agreement `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 11]`.
- **Eagle Well Services, Inc.:** A North Dakota Corporation, identified as the Seller in the subject Asset Purchase Agreement `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 12]`.
- **Gregory Wiedmer:** An individual, identified as the general or managing partner of American Well Service L.L.P. `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 13]`.
- **American Well Service L.L.P.:** A North Dakota limited liability partnership `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 14]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegations constituting the alleged Wrongful Acts are predicated upon the breach of a noncompetition covenant contained within an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 9, 2012 (the "APA") `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraphs 2, 5]`. It is alleged that Defendant Robert Mau, a shareholder of the seller entity Eagle Well Services, Inc., and a signatory to the APA, breached the noncompetition provision by participating in the formation and operation of a competing business, American Well Service L.L.P. `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 7]`. The alleged breach was effected by providing financing for the competitor and causing his affiliate, MW Industries, Inc., to manufacture and sell well service rigs to said competitor on terms substantially more favorable than those offered to the Plaintiff, thereby investing in and controlling a competing enterprise `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Paragraph 44]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 11, Paragraph 62]`. Furthermore, the complaint alleges fraudulent concealment, averring that Robert Mau and Gregory Wiedmer harbored a preconceived plan to breach the APA, which they failed to disclose to the Plaintiff's predecessor prior to the transaction `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 35]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 68]`.

### Relief Sought
The Plaintiff seeks multifaceted relief from the Court, including:
- **Injunctive Relief:** A permanent injunction prohibiting Robert Mau and Eagle Well Services from any direct or indirect breach of the APA's noncompetition covenant `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 82]`.
- **Monetary Damages:** Direct and consequential damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but stated to be not less than the total revenues received by American Well Service L.L.P. `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 83]`.
- **Equitable Relief:** Imposition of a constructive trust upon all monies and revenues received by the Defendants as a result of the alleged wrongful conduct `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 84]`.
- **Potentially Excluded Loss:** Plaintiff expressly reserves the right to seek exemplary (punitive) damages as provided under North Dakota statute `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Paragraph 85]`. The prayer for relief also includes a request for damages not less than the total revenues of American Well Service, which could be construed as a demand for the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 83]`.
- **Other Relief:** Plaintiff also seeks attorneys' fees, costs, expert witness fees, and pre-judgment interest `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Paragraphs 86-87]`.
