## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The Directors, Officers and Entity Liability Coverage Part provides the following Insuring Agreements:

> (A) Insured Person Liability
> The Insurer shall pay **Loss** on behalf of the **Insured Persons** resulting from an **Insured Person Claim** first made against the **Insured Persons** during the **Policy Period** or Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, for a **Wrongful Act** by the **Insured Persons**, except for **Loss** that an **Insured Entity** pays to or on behalf of the **Insured Persons** as indemnification.
> 
> (B) Corporate Reimbursement
> The Insurer shall pay **Loss** on behalf of an **Insured Entity** that such **Insured Entity** has, to the extent permitted or required by law, indemnified the **Insured Persons** resulting from an **Insured Person Claim** first made against the **Insured Persons** during the **Policy Period** or Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, for a **Wrongful Act** by the **Insured Persons**.
> 
> (C) Entity Liability (Elective)
> If Entity Liability Coverage is included in Item 5 of the Declarations, the Insurer shall pay **Loss** on behalf of an **Insured Entity** resulting from an **Entity Claim** first made against such **Insured Entity** during the **Policy Period** or Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, for a **Wrongful Act** by an **Insured Entity**. `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section I, Clauses A-C]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The lawsuit satisfies the definition of a **Claim** under the policy.

The Complaint constitutes a **Claim** under the Directors, Officers and Entity Liability Coverage Part `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section II, Clause A]`. The allegations against Robert Mau satisfy the definition of an **Insured Person Claim**, which includes a "civil proceeding... commenced by the service of a complaint" against an **Insured Person** `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section II, Clause F]`. The allegations against Eagle Well Services, Inc. satisfy the definition of an **Entity Claim**, which includes a "civil proceeding... commenced by the service of a complaint" against an **Insured Entity** `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section II, Clause D]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** Certain named defendants in the claim document qualify as **Insureds**.

The **Named Entity** is EAGLE OPERATING, INC. `[policy.pdf, Page 2, Item 1]`. The defendants named in the Complaint are Robert Mau, Eagle Well Services, Inc., Gregory Wiedmer, and American Well Service L.L.P. `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`.

The policy defines **Insureds** as any **Insured Entity** or **Insured Person** `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section II, Clause G]`. An **Insured Entity** is defined as the **Named Entity** or any **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section II, Clause K]`. An **Insured Person** is defined as any **Manager** or **Employee** `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section II, Clause E]`. A **Manager** includes a duly elected or appointed director or officer of an **Insured Entity** `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section II, Clause Q]`. Endorsement No. 10, which supersedes Endorsement No. 2 `[policy.pdf, Page 59, unnumbered]`, amends the definition of **Subsidiary** to include STAR WELL SERVICES, INC. and MW INDUSTRIES, INC. `[policy.pdf, Page 60, Endorsement No. 10]`. 

- Eagle Well Services, Inc. is not the **Named Entity**, nor is it listed as a **Subsidiary** in the operative Endorsement No. 10 `[policy.pdf, Page 60, Endorsement No. 10]`. Therefore, it does not qualify as an **Insured Entity**. Further information would be required to determine if it otherwise meets the definition of a **Subsidiary** under the policy `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section II, Clause W]`.

- Robert Mau is identified in the Complaint as a "shareholder in Eagle Well Services" and President of MW Industries, Inc. ("MW") `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 11]`. Since MW Industries, Inc. is a **Subsidiary** pursuant to Endorsement No. 10 `[policy.pdf, Page 60, Endorsement No. 10]`, Robert Mau qualifies as an **Insured Person** in his capacity as its President, which constitutes a **Manager** position `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section II, Clause Q]`. However, the Complaint alleges **Wrongful Acts** related to his capacity as a shareholder of Eagle Well Services and a party to the APA `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Numbers 6-8]`, not his capacity with MW Industries, Inc.

- Gregory Wiedmer is identified as the Vice President of MW `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Number 35]`. As MW Industries, Inc. is a **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 60, Endorsement No. 10]`, Gregory Wiedmer qualifies as an **Insured Person** in his capacity as its Vice President `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section II, Clause Q]`. The Complaint alleges wrongdoing by Mr. Wiedmer, but he is not named as a defendant in the first cause of action for breach of contract which is brought only against Robert Mau and Eagle Well Services `[claim.pdf, Page 10, unnumbered]`.

- American Well Service L.L.P. is a defendant `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, but it does not meet any definition of an **Insured** under the policy.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The claim alleges **Wrongful Acts** against the defendants.

The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as any actual or alleged "error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, or breach of duty committed by an **Insured Person** in their capacity as such... or... an **Insured Entity**" `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section II, Clause M]`. The Complaint alleges, inter alia, breach of contract, fraud, and civil conspiracy against the defendants `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 2]`. Specifically, it alleges Robert Mau breached the noncompetition provisions of the APA `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 6]`, concealed his intentions to do so `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 8]`, and conspired with others to defraud the plaintiff `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 8]`. These allegations constitute alleged **Wrongful Acts** as defined.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was first made during the **Policy Period** and reported in a timely manner.

The **Claim** was first made on December 27, 2013, which is within the **Policy Period** of April 29, 2013, to April 13, 2014 `[policy.pdf, Page 2, Item 3]`. The **Claim** was received by the Insurer on May 2, 2013, which is also within the **Policy Period**. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The policy requires that notice be given "as soon as practicable after a **Notice Manager** becomes aware of such **Claim**" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section VIII, Clause A]`. Based on the dates provided, the reporting appears timely.

In conclusion, the matter constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** that was first made and reported during the **Policy Period**. However, significant questions exist regarding the insured status of the primary defendants, Eagle Well Services, Inc., and whether the alleged **Wrongful Acts** of Robert Mau were committed in a covered capacity.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The policy defines **Loss** as:

> the amount that the **Insureds** are legally liable to pay solely as a result of a **Claim** covered by this Liability Coverage Part, including **Defense Costs**, compensatory damages, settlement amounts, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs awarded pursuant to judgments, and, regarding Insuring Agreement (D), **Investigation Costs**. **Loss** also includes punitive and exemplary damages, and the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award. However, **Loss** shall not include: (1) taxes, fines or penalties imposed by law; (2) non-monetary relief; (3) any other matters uninsurable pursuant to any applicable law... `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section II, Clause I]`

The plaintiff seeks several forms of relief. **Defense Costs** associated with defending the covered portions of the **Claim** would constitute **Loss** `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section II, Clause I]`. The prayer for "Direct and consequential damages" would likely qualify as **Loss** `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 2]`. The plaintiff also seeks a permanent injunction, which is a form of non-monetary relief and is expressly excluded from the definition of **Loss** `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 1]` `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section II, Clause I(2)]`. The demand for a constructive trust and the reservation of rights to seek exemplary damages may or may not be covered, depending on final adjudication and applicable law `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 3]` `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Number 4]`. Attorneys' fees sought by the plaintiff as damages `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Number 5]` may be covered if deemed part of a covered judgment or settlement. At this preliminary stage, a reservation of rights is warranted regarding which components of the damages sought will ultimately constitute covered **Loss**.

### 3. Related Claims

There are no explicit references in the Complaint to any earlier proceedings or notices that would constitute **Related Claims** under the policy. The policy states that all **Claims** arising from the same **Wrongful Act** or **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** shall be deemed a single **Claim** first made on the earliest date any such **Claim** was made or notice was given `[policy.pdf, Page 12-13, Section X]`.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following exclusions from the Directors, Officers and Entity Liability Coverage Part are analyzed for potential applicability:

**Applicable Exclusions**

*   **Prior or Pending Litigation Exclusion (IV(B))**: This exclusion is applicable. It precludes coverage for any **Claim** based upon or arising from any prior or pending demand, suit, or proceeding against any **Insureds** as of the Prior or Pending Date of December 19, 2005 `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 5]` `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause B]`. The provided documents do not contain information to suggest this exclusion applies, but its potential applicability must be noted and investigated.
*   **Prior Notice Exclusion (IV(C))**: This exclusion is applicable. It precludes coverage for any **Claim** arising from any fact, circumstance, situation or **Wrongful Act** that was the subject of any notice given under any other D&O or similar policy before the policy's inception date `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause C]`. Investigation is required to determine if such prior notice was given.
*   **Insured vs. Insured Exclusion (IV(H))**: This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** is brought by Sun Well Services, Inc., which is not an **Insured** under the policy `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`. Therefore, this exclusion, which bars coverage for claims brought by or on behalf of **Insureds**, does not apply `[policy.pdf, Page 22, Section IV, Clause H]`.
*   **Conduct Exclusions (IV(L) & IV(M))**: These exclusions are conditionally applicable. Exclusion IV(L) bars coverage for **Loss** related to an **Insured** gaining any personal profit or advantage to which they were not legally entitled `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section IV, Clause L]`. Exclusion IV(M) bars coverage for **Loss** related to any criminal or deliberately fraudulent act or willful violation of law `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section IV, Clause M]`. The Complaint alleges fraud and a scheme to gain advantage `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Numbers 8-9]`. These exclusions apply only after a "judgment or other final adjudication" establishes such conduct. Accordingly, a reservation of rights is necessary.
*   **Contract Exclusion (V(A)(1))**: This exclusion is applicable to Insuring Agreement (C) only. It precludes coverage for liability under any contract, but with a carve-back for liability that would have been incurred in the absence of the contract `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section V, Clause A(1)]`. The First Claim for Relief is for breach of contract (the APA) `[claim.pdf, Page 10, unnumbered]`. This exclusion will likely bar coverage for entity liability arising from the contractual breach, but not for tort-based liability (e.g., fraud) that might exist independent of the contract.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions**

*   **Bodily Injury / Property Damage Exclusion (IV(A))**: Not applicable. The **Claim** alleges economic damages, not bodily injury or property damage `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause A]`.
*   **Pollution Exclusion (IV(D))**: Not applicable. The allegations are unrelated to **Pollutants** `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause D]`.
*   **Labor Law Exclusion (IV(E))**: Not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve the types of labor law violations enumerated in the exclusion `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause E]`.
*   **Professional Services Exclusion (IV(F))**: Not applicable. The allegations do not arise from the rendering of professional services to a third party `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause F]`.
*   **ERISA Exclusion (IV(G))**: Not applicable. The **Claim** is not related to **ERISA** violations `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause G]`.
*   **Outside Directorship Exclusion (IV(I))**: Not applicable. The allegations do not pertain to service on the board of an entity other than an **Insured Entity** `[policy.pdf, Page 22, Section IV, Clause I]`.
*   **Claim by Outside Entity Exclusion (IV(J))**: Not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve an **Outside Entity** upon which an **Insured Person** served `[policy.pdf, Page 22, Section IV, Clause J]`.
*   **Public Offering of Securities Exclusion (IV(K))**: Not applicable. The **Claim** does not relate to a public offering of securities `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section IV, Clause K]`.
*   **Exclusions Applicable to Insuring Agreement (C)**: The remaining exclusions under this section, including employment-related wrongful acts (V(A)(2)), discrimination (V(A)(3)), various intentional torts (V(A)(4)), antitrust (V(A)(5)), and intellectual property (V(A)(6)), are not applicable as the allegations do not fall within their scope `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section V, Clause A]`. Exclusion V(B) regarding inadequate consideration for securities purchase is also not applicable `[policy.pdf, Page 24, Section V, Clause B]`.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

**Allocation Clause**: This clause is relevant. The policy provides for 100% allocation of **Defense Costs** to covered **Loss**, but allocates **Loss** other than **Defense Costs** based on relative legal exposure where a **Claim** involves both covered and uncovered matters or parties `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section XI]`. Given the presence of uninsured parties (Eagle Well Services, American Well Service) and potentially uncovered causes of action (breach of contract against the entity), allocation will be necessary.

**Defense and Settlement Clause**: This clause is relevant. It establishes the Insurer's right and duty to defend and requires the **Insureds**' consent for settlement, which cannot be unreasonably withheld `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section VII]`. **Insureds** are prohibited from admitting liability or incurring **Defense Costs** without the Insurer's prior written consent.

**Other Insurance Clause**: This clause is relevant. It provides that the policy is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section XII]`. Investigation is needed to determine if other insurance may apply to this matter.

**Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause**: This clause is relevant. The status of Eagle Well Services, Inc. is a key coverage issue. Whether it qualifies as a **Subsidiary** depends on the ownership and control structure relative to the **Named Entity**, EAGLE OPERATING, INC. `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section II, Clause W]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section XIV]`. This requires factual investigation.
## Conclusion

Based upon the foregoing analysis, there is **potential coverage** under the policy for the **Claim** asserted against Robert Mau, warranting a defense under a reservation of rights. The Complaint alleges a covered **Claim** for **Wrongful Acts** made and reported during the **Policy Period**. Robert Mau qualifies as an **Insured Person** by virtue of his role as President of MW Industries, Inc., a scheduled **Subsidiary**. However, a significant coverage issue exists as the alleged **Wrongful Acts** appear to arise from his capacity as a shareholder of Eagle Well Services, Inc., which is not an **Insured Entity**, rather than his capacity with an **Insured Entity**. A reservation of rights should be issued to address this capacity issue, the potential application of the conduct and contract exclusions pending final adjudication, and the allocation of **Loss** between covered and non-covered parties and matters.

Coverage for Eagle Well Services, Inc. should be **denied**. It does not qualify as an **Insured Entity** under the policy as it is not the **Named Entity** and is not listed as a **Subsidiary** under the operative endorsement. There is no information to suggest it otherwise meets the definition of **Subsidiary**. Consequently, there is no basis for coverage for Eagle Well Services, Inc., nor for the other uninsured defendants, Gregory Wiedmer and American Well Service L.L.P., except to the extent any **Wrongful Act** is alleged against Mr. Wiedmer in his insured capacity.
