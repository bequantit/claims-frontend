## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The **Underwriter** shall pay on behalf of the **Insureds** for **Loss** on account of any **Claim** first made against them during the **Policy Period** or the **Run-Off Coverage Period** for a **Wrongful Act** `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section I]`. Specifically:

> A. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY COVERAGE
> The Underwriter shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Persons** all **Loss** for which the **Insured Persons** are not indemnified by the **Company** and which the **Insured Persons** become legally obligated to pay on account of any **Claim** first made against them, individually or otherwise, during the **Policy Period** or the Extended Reporting Period or **Run-Off Coverage Period**, if exercised, for a **Wrongful Act** taking place before or during the **Policy Period**, subject to the Limit of Liability set forth in Item 2.A of the Declarations. `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section I, Clause A]`
> 
> B. COMPANY REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE
> The Underwriter shall pay on behalf of the **Company** all **Loss** for which the **Company** grants indemnification to the **Insured Persons**, as permitted or required by law, and which the **Insured Persons** have become legally obligated to pay on account of any **Claim** first made against them, individually or otherwise, during the **Policy Period** or the Extended Reporting Period or **Run-Off Coverage Period**, if exercised, for a **Wrongful Act** taking place before or during the **Policy Period**, subject to the Limit of Liability set forth in Item 2.A of the Declarations. `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section I, Clause B]`
> 
> C. COMPANY SECURITIES LIABLITY COVERAGE
> The Underwriter shall pay on behalf of the **Company** all **Loss** for which the **Company** becomes legally obligated to pay on account of a **Securities Claim** first made against the **Company** during the **Policy Period** or the Extended Reporting Period or **Run-Off Coverage Period**, if exercised, for a **Wrongful Act** taking place before or during the **Policy Period**, subject to the Limit of Liability set forth in Item 2.A of the Declarations. `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section I, Clause C]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The lawsuit appears to satisfy the policy's definition of a **Claim** and a **Securities Claim**.
The Amended Complaint constitutes a "civil proceeding against any **Insured** commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section III, Clause B.2]`. The complaint itself is titled "LEAD PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED COMPLAINT" `[claim.pdf, Page 2]`. Furthermore, the matter qualifies as a **Securities Claim**. As amended by Endorsement #30, a **Securities Claim** is defined as:

> any **Claim** alleging a violation of any statutory or common regulation, rule or law which in whole or in part is: (i) brought by one or more securities holders of the **Company** in their capacity as such, or derivatively, on behalf of the **Company**, against an **Insured Person** of such **Company**, or (ii) based upon, arising out of or attributable to the purchase or sale of, or offer or solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell, any securities issued by the **Company**... `[policy.pdf, Page 63, Section I]`

The lawsuit is a securities class action brought on behalf of persons who purchased Orbital ATK common stock `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 1]` and alleges violations of §§10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Number 1]`. This falls squarely within the definition of a **Securities Claim**.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** All named defendants appear to qualify as **Insureds** under the policy.
The **Policyholder** is Orbital Sciences Corporation `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Item 1]`. Pursuant to the merger, Orbital ATK is the successor to the **Policyholder** `[claim.pdf, Page 20, Number 50]` `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Number 54]`. Endorsement #36 extends coverage to the buyer, Alliant Techsystems, Inc. (which became Orbital ATK), in its capacity as the successor to the **Policyholder** `[policy.pdf, Page 69, Section II.A]`. Therefore, Orbital ATK, Inc. is a **Company** under the policy `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section III, Clause C]` and is an **Insured** for the purposes of Insuring Clause C `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section III, Clause N]`.
The individual defendants named are David W. Thompson (CEO), Garret E. Pierce (CFO), Blake E. Larson (COO), Mark W. DeYoung (Director), and Hollis M. Thompson (PAO) `[claim.pdf, Page 11, Number 17]` `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Numbers 18-22]`. The policy defines **Insured Persons** to include "any one or more natural persons who were, now are or shall become: (i) a duly elected or appointed director, Manager, officer, in-house general counsel or controller of the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section III, Clause M.1]`. All individual defendants held such positions at Orbital ATK after the merger `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Number 4]`, and therefore qualify as **Insured Persons**.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The complaint alleges numerous **Wrongful Acts** as defined by the policy.
The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as "any error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, or breach of duty actually or allegedly committed or attempted by any of the **Insured Persons**, individually or otherwise, in their capacity as such... or with respect to Insuring Clause C, by the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section III, Clause CC.1]`. The complaint alleges that the defendants made numerous false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, inter alia, merger synergies, the profitability of the Lake City Contract, the Company's financial results, and its internal controls `[claim.pdf, Page 24, Number 63]`. These allegations of misstatements and omissions fall within the definition of **Wrongful Act**.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** appears to have been timely made and reported. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage.
The original **Policy Period** was 07/01/2014 to 07/01/2015 `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Item 3]`. Endorsement #36, effective 02/09/2015, amended the **Policy Period** to end on 02/09/2015 and established a **Run-Off Coverage Period** from 02/09/2015 to 02/09/2021 `[policy.pdf, Page 69, Section I]`. The insuring clauses explicitly extend coverage to a "**Claim** first made against them... during the... **Run-Off Coverage Period**" `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section I]`. The complaint is dated October 10, 2017 `[claim.pdf, Page 111]`. As this date falls within the **Run-Off Coverage Period**, the **Claim** was first made during a covered period. As a condition precedent, the **Insureds** must give written notice of any **Claim** "as soon as practicable... but in no event later than... the expiration of the... **Run-Off Coverage Period**" `[policy.pdf, Page 51, Endorsement #18]`. The **Claim** was reported on October 12, 2017, which is within the **Run-Off Coverage Period** and is considered timely.

Based on the foregoing analysis, the lawsuit constitutes a **Securities Claim** alleging **Wrongful Acts** by **Insureds**, first made and reported during the **Run-Off Coverage Period**. As such, the insuring agreements of the policy are triggered, subject to the remaining terms and conditions.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The damages sought in the complaint appear to fall within the policy's definition of **Loss**, at least in part.

The policy, as amended by Endorsement #13, defines **Loss** as:

> the total amount the **Insureds** become legally obligated to pay on account of **Claims** made against them for **Wrongful Acts** for which coverage applies, including, but not limited to, damages, judgments, and any award of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest with respect to covered damages, settlements and **Defense Costs**. `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section III, Clause Q]` `[policy.pdf, Page 46]`

The plaintiffs' Prayer for Relief seeks an award of "compensatory damages... for all damages sustained as a result of **Defendants’** wrongdoing" and "reasonable costs and expenses incurred in this action, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees" `[claim.pdf, Page 111, Number B, Number C]`. These requested amounts constitute damages, settlements, and **Defense Costs**, which are included in the definition of **Loss**.

The definition of **Loss** excludes, inter alia, "fines or penalties imposed by law" and "matters uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this policy is construed" `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section III, Clause Q]`. It also contains specific language concerning disgorgement. As amended by Endorsement #13, the policy provides:

> the **Underwriter** shall not assert with respect to a **Securities Claim** that **Loss** incurred by any **Insured**, in the **Insured's** capacity as such, is uninsurable due to the **Insured's** actual or alleged violation of Section 11, 12 or 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply to any settlement or judgment in a **Securities Claim** if and to the extent a final and non-appealable judgment adverse to such **Insured** in the underlying action, or a final determination by a regulatory or other governmental authority, or a written admission by such **Insured** in a settlement of such **Securities Claim**, establishes such settlement or judgment constitutes disgorgement, restitution or the return of ill-gotten gain. `[policy.pdf, Page 46]`

While the complaint does not explicitly seek disgorgement or penalties, any portion of a future judgment or settlement that is adjudicated or admitted to be disgorgement, restitution, or ill-gotten gains would not be covered **Loss**. At this preliminary stage, the full scope and characterization of potential damages is unknown. Therefore, a reservation of rights is warranted with respect to whether all amounts ultimately sought constitute covered **Loss** under the policy.

### 3. Related Claims

The claim document makes no explicit reference to prior demands or proceedings that would constitute **Related Claims** under the policy. The policy states that "All **Claims** arising out of the same **Wrongful Act** and all **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** of **Insureds** shall be deemed one **Claim**" `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section V, Clause C.3]`.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following policy exclusions are potentially applicable or warrant discussion.

**Applicable or Potentially Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **I. Personal Conduct (Fraud):** This exclusion, as amended by Endorsement #14, precludes coverage for **Loss** "based upon, arising out of or attributable to any deliberately fraudulent act or omission or any willful violation of any statute or regulation committed by such **Insured**, if a final and non-appealable adjudication adverse to such **Insured** in the underlying action establishes such a deliberately fraudulent act or omission or willful violation" `[policy.pdf, Page 47]`. The complaint alleges fraudulent conduct and violations of securities laws `[claim.pdf, Page 93, Number 247]`. However, this exclusion is conditional and applies only after a final, non-appealable adverse adjudication. At this stage, the **Underwriter** must advance **Defense Costs** for these allegations, subject to a reservation of rights to deny coverage for any judgment or settlement and to recoup **Defense Costs** if the required adjudication occurs.

*   **J. Personal Conduct (Illegal Profit):** This exclusion, as amended by Endorsement #14, precludes coverage for **Loss** "based upon, arising out of or attributable to such **Insured Person** gaining any profit, remuneration or financial advantage to which such **Insured** was not legally entitled, if a final and non-appealable adjudication adverse to such **Insured** in the underlying action establishes such **Insured** in fact gained any such profit, remuneration or advantage" `[policy.pdf, Page 47]`. The complaint alleges that defendants received substantial bonuses and salary increases based on the success of the merger and inflated financial results `[claim.pdf, Page 77, Number 204]` `[claim.pdf, Page 80, Number 215]`. This exclusion is also conditional upon a final, non-appealable adverse adjudication and is subject to a reservation of rights.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **A. Prior Notice:** Not applicable. This exclusion, as amended by Endorsement #34, precludes coverage for claims arising from any fact, circumstance, or situation that was the subject of written notice given and accepted under any prior directors and officers liability policy `[policy.pdf, Page 67]`. There is no information to suggest such prior notice was given.

*   **B. Pending or Prior Litigation:** Not applicable. This exclusion, as amended by Endorsement #27, precludes coverage for claims arising from any suit or proceeding pending on or before the Pending or Prior Date of 11/11/1996 `[policy.pdf, Page 60]` `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Item 6]`. The current matter arose from events well after this date.

*   **C. Insured vs. Insured:** Not applicable. This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement #6, precludes coverage for claims brought by or on behalf of any **Company** against any **Insured** `[policy.pdf, Page 34, Section I]`. The claim is brought by third-party securityholders, not by an **Insured**.

*   **D. Outside Position:** Not applicable. This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement #6, pertains to claims arising from an **Insured Person's** service in an **Outside Position** `[policy.pdf, Page 34, Section I]`. The allegations in the complaint relate to the **Insureds'** conduct in their capacities for the **Company**, not an **Outside Entity**.

*   **E. ERISA:** Not applicable. This exclusion pertains to claims for violations of ERISA or similar laws related to employee benefit plans `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section IV, Clause E]`. The complaint does not allege such violations.

*   **F. Bodily Injury/Property Damage:** Not applicable. This exclusion for bodily injury or property damage contains a carve-back for **Securities Claims** `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section IV, Clause F]`, as amended by Endorsement #8 `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section III]`. As this is a **Securities Claim**, the exclusion does not apply.

*   **G. Environmental:** This exclusion was deleted by Endorsement #33 `[policy.pdf, Page 66, Section II]` and is therefore not considered.

*   **H. Other Capacity:** Not applicable. This exclusion pertains to service in a capacity for an organization other than the **Company** or in an **Outside Position** `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section IV, Clause H]`. The allegations relate to the **Insureds'** conduct in their capacities for the **Company**.

*   **Wage & Hour (Added by Endorsement #9):** Not applicable. This exclusion pertains to claims for violations of wage and hour laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act `[policy.pdf, Page 39]`. The complaint does not contain such allegations. Furthermore, the exclusion contains a carve-back for a **Securities Claim**, which this is.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause:** This clause is applicable. The policy provides that if a **Claim** involves both covered **Loss** and uncovered loss, "the **Insureds** and the **Underwriter** shall use their best efforts to allocate such amount between covered **Loss** and uncovered loss" `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section V, Clause D]`. Given the potential for uncovered loss (e.g., disgorgement, amounts related to adjudicated fraud), allocation may be required.

*   **Defense and Settlement Clause:** This clause is applicable. It provides that the **Insureds** shall not settle any **Claim** or incur **Defense Costs** without the **Underwriter's** written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section V, Clause F]`. The **Underwriter** has the right to associate in the defense and settlement of the **Claim**.

*   **Other Insurance Clause:** This clause is applicable. As amended by Endorsement #31, it provides that the policy is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance, unless such other insurance is written as specific excess to this policy `[policy.pdf, Page 64]`. This provision would apply if other insurance policies provide coverage for this **Claim**.

*   **Changes in Exposure Clause:** This clause is relevant as it governs the transition of coverage following the merger of Orbital Sciences Corporation. Specifically, section V.E.2, Acquisition of **Policyholder**, triggered the availability of the **Run-Off Coverage Period** that is now in effect `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section V, Clause E.2]`.

*   **Claim Interrelation/Related Claims Clause:** This clause, found in Subsection V.C.3, is potentially relevant. It states that all **Claims** arising from the same or **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** are deemed a single **Claim** made at the time the earliest **Claim** was made `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section V, Clause C.3]`. This would subject all such **Claims** to a single Limit of Liability. While no prior **Claims** are identified in the complaint, this provision would become operative if any are discovered.


## Conclusion

Based on the analysis herein, there is **potential coverage** for the **Claim** under the Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Policy, Policy No. DOC 6548131 05. The lawsuit constitutes a **Securities Claim** alleging covered **Wrongful Acts** against **Insureds**, and it was first made and reported during the policy's **Run-Off Coverage Period**. As such, the **Underwriter's** duty to advance **Defense Costs**, subject to the policy's terms and the applicable Retention, is triggered.

This preliminary coverage position is subject to a comprehensive reservation of rights. Potential coverage issues that warrant reservation include, but are not limited to, the allocation of **Loss** between covered and non-covered matters, the ultimate characterization of damages sought (specifically as it relates to potential disgorgement or other uninsurable amounts), and the potential future application of the personal conduct exclusions pending a final, non-appealable adjudication. The initial coverage position is subject to change as additional facts are developed through discovery and the course of litigation.
