## CLASS ACTION vs. Orbital ATK, Inc., et al.
### Submission Summary
This executive summary delineates a third-party claim, presented as a Lead Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint, initiated on October 10, 2017, within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The claimants, specifically identified as Construction Laborers Pension Trust of Greater St. Louis and Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System `[claim.pdf, Page 11, Paragraphs 14-15]`, have commenced a securities class action lawsuit against the insured entity, Orbital ATK, Inc., and certain affiliated individuals. The action seeks legal remedies for purported violations of federal securities laws, stemming from alleged material misstatements and omissions concerning a significant government contract.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
Pursuant to the claim documentation, the parties named as defendants are as follows:

*   **Orbital ATK, Inc.:** The corporate entity and insured `[claim.pdf, Page 11, Paragraph 17]`.
*   **David W. Thompson:** An individual, serving as the Chief Executive Officer and President of Orbital ATK, Inc. `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 18]`.
*   **Garret E. Pierce:** An individual, serving as the Chief Financial Officer of Orbital ATK, Inc. `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 19]`.

*   **Hollis M. Thompson:** An individual, serving as the Vice President of Financial Reporting and Principal Accounting Officer of Orbital ATK, Inc. `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 22]`.

The claim collectively refers to the individuals as the “Individual Defendants” and all parties as the “Defendants” `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 23]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegations constituting the purported Wrongful Acts revolve around a series of material misrepresentations and omissions in public statements and financial reports concerning the 'Lake City Contract,' a significant agreement for the manufacture of small-caliber ammunition `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 2]`. The claimants allege that the Defendants, subsequent to the merger forming Orbital ATK, Inc., falsely touted the success of said merger and the achievement of substantial cost synergies, while concealing that the Lake City Contract was operating at a substantial loss `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Paragraph 6]`. It is alleged that Alliant, a predecessor entity, secured the contract by submitting a bid that was hundreds of millions of dollars below the actual cost of performance `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 2]`. Consequently, the Defendants are accused of disseminating false and misleading financial statements by failing to record a forward loss on said contract in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the Company’s own stated accounting policies `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Paragraph 6]`. This conduct, which resulted in the material overstatement of financial performance and the understatement of liabilities, allegedly continued for over a year post-merger, thereby artificially inflating the company's stock price `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Paragraph 10]`. Furthermore, the claim alleges that certifications regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting were false, as material weaknesses existed which failed to prevent or detect these misstatements `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Paragraph 8]`.

### Relief Sought
The claimants petition the Court for the following forms of relief:

*   **Declaratory Judgment:** A declaration that the action is a proper class action `[claim.pdf, Page 111, Paragraph A]`.
*   **Compensatory Damages:** An award of compensatory damages in favor of the Plaintiffs and the Class against all Defendants, jointly and severally, for all damages sustained as a result of the alleged wrongdoing, in an amount to be determined at trial, inclusive of interest `[claim.pdf, Page 111, Paragraph B]`.
*   **Costs and Expenses:** An award for reasonable costs and expenses incurred, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees `[claim.pdf, Page 111, Paragraph C]`.
*   **Injunctive or Equitable Relief:** Such other and further relief, including any injunctive or other equitable relief, as the Court deems just and proper `[claim.pdf, Page 111, Paragraph D]`.

The complaint does not explicitly seek relief in the form of fines, penalties, taxes, disgorgement, or punitive damages, focusing on compensatory damages for economic losses sustained by investors. The claimants also demand a trial by jury `[claim.pdf, Page 111, N/A]`.

### Counts
The claim enumerates the following causes of action:

*   **Count I:** For Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Against All Defendants `[claim.pdf, Page 93, N/A]`.
*   **Count II:** For Violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act Against Defendants Thompson, Pierce, Larson, and Hollis Thompson `[claim.pdf, Page 95, N/A]`.
*   **Count III:** For Violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 Against All Joint Proxy Defendants (Orbital ATK, Thompson, Pierce, and DeYoung) `[claim.pdf, Page 108, N/A]`.
*   **Count IV:** For Violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act Against DeYoung, Thompson, and Pierce `[claim.pdf, Page 110, N/A]`.

### References to Related Claims
The claim documentation makes reference to prior proceedings and investigations that are material to the instant matter. Specifically, it is noted that the Court had previously adjudicated a motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 1]`. The document also discloses that, as a consequence of the financial restatements, the Company became the subject of a “non-public” investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) `[claim.pdf, Page 61, Paragraph 154]`. Finally, the claim references a prior financial restatement announced on March 15, 2016, which pertained to inaccurate accounting for certain long-term contracts, separate from but involving similar accounting principles as the Lake City Contract `[claim.pdf, Page 49, Paragraph 117]`. These references are germane to the analysis of potential 'Related Claims' under the policy.
