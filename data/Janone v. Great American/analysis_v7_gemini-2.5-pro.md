## Policy Summary

This analysis pertains to the Public Solution Insurance Policy number **DOL3664294**, issued by **Great American Insurance Company** (the **Insurer**) to **APPLIANCE RECYCLING CENTERS OF AMERICA INC.** (the **Corporation**) `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 1]`. The policy provides an aggregate **Limit of Liability** of $5,000,000 for the **Policy Period** `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 3]`. The applicable retentions per **Claim** are $0 for Insuring Agreement A, and $250,000 for each **Securities Claim** under Insuring Agreements B and/or C `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 4]`. An additional retention of $500,000 applies to each **M&A Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Number 4]`, which supersedes the **Securities Claim** retention if a **Claim** constitutes both `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Number 4]`.

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The policy's Insuring Agreements, as modified by Endorsement D23428(1), state `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Number 1]`:

> A. The **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Persons** all **Loss** which the **Insured Persons** shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a **Claim** (including an **Employment Practices Claim**, a **Securities Claim** or a **M&A Claim**) first made against the **Insured Persons** during the **Policy Period** or the **Discovery Period** for a **Wrongful Act**, except for any **Loss** which the **Company** actually pays as indemnification.
> B. The **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Company** all **Loss** which the **Insured Persons** shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a **Claim** (including an **Employment Practices Claim**, a **Securities Claim** or a **M&A Claim**) first made against the **Insured Persons** during the **Policy Period** or the **Discovery Period** for a **Wrongful Act**, but only to the extent the **Company** is required or permitted by law to indemnify the **Insured Persons**.
> C. The **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Entity** all **Loss** which the **Insured Entity** shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a **Securities Claim** or a **M&A Claim** first made against the **Insured Entity** during the **Policy Period** or the **Discovery Period** for a **Wrongful Act**.

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The Complaint satisfies the policy's definition of a **Claim**.
The matter at issue is a civil proceeding initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against multiple defendants, commenced by the filing of a Complaint `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. This falls squarely within the definition of a **Claim** as a "civil... proceeding... made against any **Insured** seeking monetary or non-monetary relief and commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section III, Clause A(2)]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the claim document partially qualify as **Insureds** under the Policy.
The **Corporation** named as the policyholder is **APPLIANCE RECYCLING CENTERS OF AMERICA INC.** `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 1]`, which is the former name of defendant **JanOne Inc.** ("JOI/ARCA") `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 9]`. As the **Corporation**, **JanOne Inc.** is part of the definition of **Company** `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section III, Clause C]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section III, Clause B(1)]` and therefore qualifies as an **Insured Entity** for the purposes of Insuring Agreement I.C `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause J]`. Defendant **Virland A. Johnson** is alleged to have served as CFO of JOI/ARCA since August 2017 `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Number 12]`. In this capacity, he qualifies as an "**Officer**" `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section III, Clause E]` and thus an **Insured Person** under the Policy `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause K]`. The other defendants—Live Ventures Incorporated, John Isaac, and Kingston Diversified Holdings LLC—are not the **Corporation**, a **Subsidiary** thereof, or an employee, **Director**, or **Officer** of the **Company**, and therefore do not appear to qualify as **Insureds** under the Policy `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section III, Clause B]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause K]`. No information is provided to suggest they would qualify as an **Insured Person** or **Insured Entity** under any other provision.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The Complaint alleges numerous **Wrongful Acts** against the **Insureds**.
The Complaint alleges that **JanOne Inc.** and **Virland A. Johnson** engaged in a scheme to falsely represent the closing date of the ApplianceSmart transaction `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 6]` and that **Johnson** aided and abetted materially false and misleading statements and improper income recognition `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 4]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 15]`. These allegations constitute an "actual or alleged act, omission, error, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty" by **Insured Persons** in their capacity with the **Company** and by the **Insured Entity**, which falls within the Policy's definition of **Wrongful Act** `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section III, Clause R(1)]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section III, Clause R(2)]`.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was not timely made and reported under the terms of the Policy.
For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage.
The **Policy Period** is from September 1, 2018, to June 1, 2019 `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 2]`. The subject **Claim** was first made on August 2, 2021, with the filing of the SEC Complaint `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. This date is after the expiration of the **Policy Period**. Coverage under a claims-made policy requires that the **Claim** be first made during the **Policy Period** or an applicable **Discovery Period** `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Number 1]`. The Policy provides for the purchase of a **Discovery Period** upon cancellation or non-renewal `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section II]`. However, there is no information to suggest that the **Insureds** exercised their right to purchase a **Discovery Period**. Absent the purchase of a **Discovery Period**, the **Claim** was not made within the required timeframe, and as such, it is not a covered **Claim** under this Policy.

Based on the foregoing, since the **Claim** was not first made during the **Policy Period** and there is no indication that a **Discovery Period** was purchased, coverage is not triggered under any of the Insuring Agreements. The analysis that follows is provided for informational purposes only, in the event it is determined that a **Discovery Period** was, in fact, purchased.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The SEC Complaint seeks remedies that are partially excluded from the policy's definition of **Loss**. As modified by Endorsement D23631(3), **Loss** is defined as:

> "settlements and judgments, pre-judgment and/or post-judgment interest, compensatory damages, punitive, aggravated or exemplary damages or the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award, SOX 304/SOX 308/Dodd-Frank 954 Costs, **Investigative Costs** and **Costs of Defense**." `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause L]`

The definition explicitly excludes, among other things, "criminal or civil fines or penalties imposed by law" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause L(1)]`. The Complaint specifically requests that the Court assess "civil money penalties" against the defendants, including **JanOne Inc.** and **Virland A. Johnson** `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 8]`. Such civil penalties, if imposed, would not constitute covered **Loss**. The Complaint also seeks an order for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 8]`. While not explicitly listed as an exclusion in the definition of **Loss**, disgorgement is generally considered a non-insurable, restorative remedy under the law of most jurisdictions, and may be uninsurable pursuant to the exclusion for "any matter which may be deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Policy is construed" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause L(6)]`. The costs to defend against these allegations would, however, fall within the definition of **Costs of Defense** and thus constitute covered **Loss** `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section III, Clause D]`.

### 3. Related Claims

There is no explicit reference in the provided documents to any prior notice or **Claim** that would be deemed related to the current **Claim** under the Policy's definition of **Related Wrongful Acts** `[policy.pdf, Page 37, Section III, Clause O]` or its claim interrelation provision `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section VI, Clause B]`.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following is an exhaustive analysis of the Policy's exclusions as applied to the allegations in the **Claim**.

**Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Exclusion A (Personal Profit/Fraudulent Acts):** As modified by Endorsement D23631(3) `[policy.pdf, Page 17]`, this exclusion precludes coverage for **Loss** brought about by any **Insureds** gaining personal profit to which they were not legally entitled, or by deliberately fraudulent or criminal acts. The Complaint alleges fraudulent schemes to mislead investors and manipulate financial results `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 3]`. This exclusion is conditional and applies only upon a "final, non-appealable adjudication as to such conduct in the underlying proceeding" `[policy.pdf, Page 17, Section IV, Clause A]`. Therefore, a reservation of rights is appropriate pending final adjudication.
*   **Exclusion C (Prior & Pending Litigation):** This exclusion bars coverage for **Claims** arising from any proceeding pending as of or prior to the Prior and Pending Date of 4/1/2003 `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 7]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause C]`. The Complaint does not suggest any connection to proceedings prior to this date. However, its applicability cannot be fully ruled out without a complete litigation history of the **Insureds**.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Exclusion B (Prior Notice):** Not applicable. There is no indication that any fact, circumstance, or **Wrongful Act** alleged was the subject of a notice under a prior policy `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause B]`.
*   **Exclusion D (Bodily Injury/Property Damage):** Not applicable. The **Claim** alleges financial and economic harm, not bodily injury, property damage, or the enumerated personal injuries `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause D]`.
*   **Exclusion E (ERISA):** Not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause E]`.
*   **Exclusion F (Other Entity Capacity):** Not applicable. The allegations against **Johnson** pertain to his capacity as CFO of JOI/ARCA (the **Company**), not his capacity with an entity other than the **Company** or an **Outside Entity** `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause F]`.
*   **Exclusion G (Outside Entity vs. Insured):** As modified by Endorsement D23631(3) `[policy.pdf, Page 17]`, this exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve an **Insured Person**'s service on behalf of an **Outside Entity** `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section IV, Clause G]`.
*   **Exclusion H (Insured vs. Insured):** As modified by Endorsement D23631(3) `[policy.pdf, Page 16]`, this exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** is brought by the SEC, an external third party, not by or on behalf of the **Company** or another **Insured** `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section IV, Clause H]`.
*   **Exclusion I (Pollution):** This exclusion was deleted by Endorsement D23631(3) `[policy.pdf, Page 18]`. Therefore, it is not considered for this analysis.
*   **Exclusion J (Subsidiary Acts):** Not applicable. The **Claim** does not allege **Wrongful Acts** of a **Subsidiary** or its personnel that occurred prior to it becoming a **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 40, Section IV, Clause J]`.
*   **Exclusion K (Other Insurance):** This exclusion was deleted by Endorsement D23631(3) `[policy.pdf, Page 19]`. Therefore, it is not considered for this analysis.
*   **Economic and Trade Sanctions Clause:** Added by Endorsement IL 73 24 `[policy.pdf, Page 30]`, this exclusion is not applicable as there is no indication that providing coverage would violate trade or economic sanctions.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause**: The Policy contains an allocation provision at Section VII.D `[policy.pdf, Page 42, Section VII, Clause D]`. As the Complaint names both covered parties (**JanOne Inc., Virland A. Johnson**) and non-covered parties (Live Ventures Incorporated, John Isaac, Kingston Diversified Holdings LLC), and seeks both potentially covered **Loss** (**Costs of Defense**) and uncovered **Loss** (civil penalties, disgorgement), allocation of **Loss** will be necessary.
*   **Defense and Settlement Clause**: As modified by Endorsement D23631(3) `[policy.pdf, Page 21]`, Section VII.A requires the **Insurer**'s prior written consent for the **Insureds** to incur **Costs of Defense** or settle any **Claim**, and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The **Insureds**, not the **Insurer**, have the duty to defend `[policy.pdf, Page 41, Section VII, Clause B]`.
*   **Other Insurance Clause**: Added by Endorsement D23631(3) `[policy.pdf, Page 19]`, this clause states that the Policy shall apply as excess over any other valid and collectible insurance, with certain exceptions. Its applicability would depend on the existence of other insurance policies held by the **Insureds**.
*   **Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause**: The policy contains provisions governing coverage for newly acquired or created subsidiaries and for acquisitions of the **Company** itself `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section IX, Clause D]`. These provisions are not immediately relevant to the instant **Claim** but are noted.


## Conclusion

Based on the analysis herein, coverage for the **Claim** is respectfully **denied**. The dispositive issue is that the **Claim** was first made on August 2, 2021, which is subsequent to the expiration of the **Policy Period** on June 1, 2019 `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 2]`. This is a claims-made policy, which requires a **Claim** to be first made against an **Insured** during the **Policy Period** or an active **Discovery Period** to trigger coverage `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Number 1]`. The provided information does not indicate that the **Insureds** purchased a **Discovery Period**, which is a condition precedent to extending the reporting window `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section II, Clause B]`.

Should it be established that a **Discovery Period** was purchased and is in effect, there would be a potential for coverage, primarily for the **Costs of Defense** incurred by **JanOne Inc.** and **Virland A. Johnson**. However, this potential coverage would be subject to a significant reservation of rights. Grounds for this reservation would include, but not be limited to, the application of the Personal Profit/Fraudulent Acts exclusion pending a final adjudication, and the allocation of **Loss** between covered and uncovered parties and between covered and uncovered damages, specifically noting that any civil penalties or disgorgement would likely not constitute covered **Loss**.
