### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)

The Complaint delineates three distinct fraudulent schemes constituting Wrongful Acts under the policy:

1.  **Improper Revenue Recognition and Stock Promotion:** In late 2016, Defendant Jon Isaac, with assistance from Defendant Johnson, allegedly orchestrated a fraudulent transaction post-fiscal year-end to improperly recognize $915,500 of “other income” in LIVE’s fiscal year 2016 financial statements, thereby inflating pre-tax income by twenty percent `[claim.pdf, Page 2, 3, Paragraph 4]` and `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraph 15]`. This was allegedly effected by backdating an amendment to a contract with Novalk Apps S.A.S. `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraph 16]`. Subsequently, Defendants LIVE and Jon Isaac disseminated a press release containing a fraudulently inflated earnings per share figure and, in concert with Defendant Kingston, arranged to sell LIVE stock to capitalize on the anticipated stock price increase `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 4]`. The scheme involved materially false and misleading statements in LIVE’s Form 10-K and subsequent denials to shareholders and FINRA `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 4]`.
2.  **Fraudulent Acquisition Accounting:** In late 2017 and early 2018, Defendants LIVE, JOI/ARCA, Jon Isaac, and Johnson allegedly engaged in a scheme to falsely represent that LIVE had acquired ApplianceSmart from JOI/ARCA as of December 30, 2017 `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 5]` and `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 6]`. This misrepresentation enabled LIVE to improperly recognize a “bargain purchase gain” exceeding $3.7 million, thereby converting a quarterly loss into a net income in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ending December 31, 2017, when in fact LIVE did not gain effective control of the subsidiary until 2018 `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 5]`.
3.  **Undisclosed Executive Compensation and Internal Control Failures:** During the period from 2016 through 2018, LIVE allegedly failed to accurately disclose the total compensation paid to Defendant Jon Isaac, reporting $162,000 in temporary housing allowances while an additional $315,000 was actually disbursed `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 7]`. Furthermore, the Complaint alleges that during this period, LIVE failed to maintain effective internal accounting controls sufficient to ensure accurate reporting in its public filings `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 7]`.

### Relief Sought

The Plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission, petitions the Court for the following forms of relief:

*   **Permanent Injunctions:** An order permanently enjoining each Defendant from future violations of the federal securities laws `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 8]`.
*   **Officer and Director Bar:** An order permanently barring Defendants Jon Isaac and Virland A. Johnson from acting as an officer or director of any public issuer `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 8]`.
*   **Disgorgement:** An order requiring Defendants Jon Isaac and Kingston to disgorge all ill-gotten gains derived from the alleged misconduct, with prejudgment interest thereon. This may constitute a Loss not covered by the policy `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 8]`.
*   **Civil Monetary Penalties:** An assessment of civil monetary penalties against all Defendants. Such penalties are typically excluded from the definition of Loss `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 8]`.

### Counts
The Complaint alleges violations of the following sections of the federal securities laws, which form the basis for the causes of action:

*   Violations of Section 20(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 1]`.
*   Violations of Section 20(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 1]` and `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 8]`.
*   Violations of Section 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 1]`.
