### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The Complaint alleges that Defendants engaged in a course of conduct constituting a Wrongful Act by making materially false and misleading statements and/or omitting to state material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading. The core allegations assert that Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) the Company was, and remains, under an active investigation by the United States Department of Justice for violations of the False Claims Act `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 3]`; (ii) the Company's purported growth was attributable to illicit gifts or payments to healthcare providers and undisclosed related-party transactions with entities owned by its Head of Sales, in potential violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 3]`; (iii) the Company’s proprietary software, Clover Assistant, was not being used by physicians as represented, with only a small fraction of providers utilizing the platform `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 3]`; and (iv) the Company's financial statements were not in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) due to the failure to disclose material related-party transactions `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Paragraph 3]`. These alleged misstatements and omissions are claimed to have artificially inflated the price of Clover securities during the Class Period `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 43]`.

### Relief Sought
The Prayer for Relief petitions the Court for judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs and the Class against all Defendants `[claim.pdf, Page 138, Paragraph XII]`.

Additionally, the claimants seek an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper `[claim.pdf, Page 138, Paragraph XII]`. The Complaint seeks monetary damages caused by the alleged violations `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 1]`, and does not explicitly request relief in the form of fines, penalties, taxes, disgorgement, or punitive damages.

### References to Related Claims
The Complaint contains several references to prior or concurrent regulatory matters and investigations which may be germane to a Related Claims analysis. Specifically, the pleading alleges that Clover was and remains under an active, undisclosed investigation by the Department of Justice (`DOJ`) for violations of the False Claims Act `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 3]`. The Complaint states this DOJ investigation originated from physician complaints in Pennsylvania and that Clover was notified of the investigation “right away” `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraph 16]`. The Complaint also references prior regulatory sanctions against Clover by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (`CMS`) `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 16]` and a settlement between a separate company operated by Defendant Garipalli, CarePoint Health, and the New Jersey State Department of Medicare `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 16]`. Furthermore, it is noted that Defendant Garipalli's prior company, CarePoint Health, was the subject of a state investigation in New Jersey regarding the siphoning of funds `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 34]` and separately settled with the New Jersey Medicaid Fraud Division regarding billing claims `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 35]`.
