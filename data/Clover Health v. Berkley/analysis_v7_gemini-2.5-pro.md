## Policy Summary

This analysis pertains to the Directors' and Officers' and Corporate Liability Insurance Policy number BPRO8058026, issued by Berkley Insurance Company (`[policy.pdf, Page 1, Policy Number]`). The policyholder, designated as the **Parent Organization**, is Clover Health Investments, Corp. (`[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 1]`). The policy's aggregate **Limit of Liability** for all coverages combined is not specified in the provided excerpts of the Declarations Page (`[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 3]`). Similarly, the specific monetary amounts for the Retentions are not provided, although the policy indicates that different retentions apply for a **Securities Claim**, **Wrongful Employment Acts**, and a **Merger or Acquisition Claim**, among others (`[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 4]`).

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The **Insurer**'s primary coverage obligations are set forth in Section I, Insuring Agreements:

> Coverage A. Directors and Officers Liability Coverage
> The **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Persons**, **Loss**:
> (1) which the **Insured Persons** are legally obligated to pay resulting from any **Claim** first made against the **Insured Persons** during the Policy Period or the Extended Reporting Period (if applicable) and reported to the **Insurer** pursuant to the terms of this policy for any actual or alleged **Wrongful Act**; ...
> except and to the extent that the **Company** has indemnified the **Insured Persons** for such **Loss**. `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Section I, Clause A]`

> Coverage B. Corporate Indemnification Coverage
> The **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Company**, **Loss**:
> (1) which the **Company** is legally obligated to pay resulting from any **Claim** first made against the **Insured Persons** ... for any actual or alleged **Wrongful Act**; ...
> but only to the extent that the **Company** has indemnified the **Insured Persons** for such **Loss**. `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Section I, Clause B]`

> Coverage C. Corporate Entity Coverage
> The **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Company**, **Loss**:
> (1) which the **Company** is legally obligated to pay resulting from any **Securities Claim** first made against the **Company** during the Policy Period or the Extended Reporting Period (if applicable) and reported to the **Insurer** pursuant to the terms of this policy for any actual or alleged **Wrongful Act**... `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Section I, Clause C]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The submitted lawsuit appears to satisfy the Policy's definition of a **Claim**. The lawsuit constitutes a civil proceeding for monetary relief commenced by the service of a complaint `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The Policy, as amended by Endorsement #3, defines a **Claim**, in pertinent part, as "a civil...proceeding for monetary, non-monetary, injunctive, or equitable relief that is commenced by...service of a complaint or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section A, Clause 2]`. Furthermore, the allegations concern violations of federal securities laws `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, which squarely meets the definition of a **Securities Claim** under the Policy: "a **Claim**...alleging a violation of any federal, state, local or foreign regulation, rule, statute or common law regulating securities that is brought by...any person or entity alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, in whole or in part, the purchase or sale, or offer or solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell, any securities or membership interests in the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section II, Clause GG(1)a(i)]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the **Claim** document appear to qualify as **Insureds** under the Policy. The **Parent Organization** is Clover Health Investments, Corp. `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 1]`, which is a named defendant `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The **Company** is a defined **Insured** `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section II, Clause P]`. The individual defendants are Vivek Garipalli (CEO and Chairman), Andrew Toy (President, CTO, and Board member), Joe Wagner (CFO), and Chamath Palihapitiya (former CEO and Chairman of SCH) `[claim.pdf, Page 11-12, Numbers 32, 37, 38, 39]`. The Policy defines **Insured Person** to include "any past, present or future duly elected or appointed director, officer...of the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section II, Clause Q(1)]`. As CEO, President, CTO, CFO and/or members of the Board of Directors, Messrs. Garipalli, Toy, and Wagner qualify as **Insured Persons**. Mr. Palihapitiya's status as a former CEO and Chairman of SCH, the predecessor entity, would also qualify him as a past officer and director of the **Company**, thereby affording him status as an **Insured Person** under the Policy `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section II, Clause Q(1)]`.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The **Claim** alleges one or more **Wrongful Acts**. The lawsuit alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, encompassing materially false and misleading statements and omissions `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 83, Section VI]`. The Policy defines a **Wrongful Act**, with respect to **Insured Persons**, as "any actual or alleged breach of duty, neglect, error, act, omission, misstatement, misleading statement...by any **Insured Person** in their capacity as such" `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section II, Clause LL(1)]`. With respect to the **Company**, a **Wrongful Act** is defined as "any actual or alleged breach of duty, neglect, error, act, omission, misstatement, or misleading statement by the **Company**, but solely as respects a **Securities Claim**" `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section II, Clause LL(2)]`. The allegations of making false statements and failing to disclose material information in connection with securities transactions fall squarely within these definitions `[claim.pdf, Page 83, Section VI]`. The Policy, as amended by Endorsement #3, further expands the definition to include acts of an **Insured Person** acting in their capacity as a "Control Person" under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is explicitly alleged against the individual defendants `[claim.pdf, Page 137, Section XI]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 24, Section A, Clause 18]`.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was timely made and reported. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The **Claim**, in the form of the First Amended Complaint, was filed and thus first made on June 28, 2021 `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. This date falls within the **Policy Period** of January 7, 2021 to January 7, 2022 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 2]`. The **Claim** was reported to the **Insurer** on June 30, 2021, which is "as soon as practicable" and well within the 60-day post-policy period reporting window required by the Policy `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section VI, Clause A]`.

Based on the foregoing analysis, the **Claim** constitutes a **Securities Claim** alleging a **Wrongful Act** by **Insureds**, first made and reported during the **Policy Period**. Accordingly, the Insuring Agreements of the Policy are triggered, establishing a preliminary potential for coverage under Coverages A, B, and C, subject to the remaining terms, conditions, and exclusions of the Policy. In the absence of information indicating the **Company** is unable or unwilling to indemnify its directors and officers, the initial analysis proceeds under Coverage B for the **Insured Persons**' **Loss** and Coverage C for the **Company**'s **Loss** `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Section I, Clauses B, C]`.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The damages sought in the **Claim** appear to fall, at least in part, within the Policy's definition of **Loss**. The prayer for relief seeks an award of compensatory damages in favor of Plaintiffs and other class members `[claim.pdf, Page 138, Prayer for Relief]`. The Policy's definition of **Loss**, as amended by Endorsement #3, explicitly includes "damages, judgments (including any award of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest), settlements" and "**Defense Costs**" `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section II, Clause U(1)]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 22, Section A, Clause 10]`. 

The definition of **Loss** excludes certain items, including "civil or criminal fines or penalties" and "matters which are uninsurable under the law" `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Section II, Clause U(2)]`. The **Claim** does not explicitly seek fines or penalties, but seeks recovery of damages caused by the defendants' violations `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`. However, should any portion of a future judgment or settlement be characterized as restitution or the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, such amounts may be argued to be uninsurable as a matter of public policy or otherwise excluded from the definition of **Loss**. The Policy states the **Insurer** shall not assert that any portion of a settlement in a **Securities Claim** constitutes disgorgement or uninsurable **Loss** due to alleged violations of Sections 11, 12, or 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Section II, Clause U(3)]`, but this protection does not explicitly extend to claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as alleged herein. 

At this preliminary stage, a reservation of rights is warranted regarding the extent to which any ultimate settlement or judgment constitutes covered **Loss**, particularly with respect to any amounts that could be characterized as disgorgement or restitution.

### 3. Related Claims

The provided **Claim** document does not contain explicit reference to any prior **Claim** or circumstance previously reported to an insurer that would constitute a **Related Claim** under the Policy `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section II, Clause EE]`. The Complaint does reference an undisclosed DOJ investigation `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 3]`, which could potentially constitute a prior **Preliminary Inquiry**. However, there is no information to suggest this investigation was reported to the **Insurer** or any prior insurer. Therefore, based on the documents provided, the **Claim** appears to be a new, distinct matter. A single **Retention** and the Policy's **Limit of Liability** will apply to this **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section IV, Clause B(2)]`.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following is an analysis of the applicability of the Policy's exclusions to the present **Claim**.

**Applicable Exclusions (Subject to Reservation of Rights)**

*   **Exclusion A (Illegal Remuneration/Profit):** This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement #3, applies to **Loss** based upon, arising out of, or attributable to any illegal remuneration, personal profit or other financial advantage to which an **Insured** was not legally entitled `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section B, Clause 1]`. The **Claim** alleges that the defendants' conduct was part of a fraudulent scheme that allowed them to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in profits `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Number 19]`. This exclusion is conditional and applies only upon a "final and non-appealable adjudication in the underlying action adverse to such **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section B, Clause 1]`. Accordingly, the **Insurer** reserves its rights to apply this exclusion pending such an adjudication.

*   **Exclusion B (Deliberate Criminal or Fraudulent Act):** This exclusion applies to **Loss** based upon, arising out of, or attributable to any deliberate criminal or deliberate fraudulent act `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section III, Clause B]`. The **Claim** alleges fraudulent conduct and violations of securities laws which require a finding of scienter, or intent to deceive `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 3]`. Similar to Exclusion A, this exclusion is conditional upon a "final and non-appealable adjudication in the underlying action adverse to an **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section III, Clause B]`. The **Insurer** reserves its rights to apply this exclusion pending such an adjudication.

*   **Past Acts Exclusion (Endorsement #2):** This exclusion is applicable, but a carve-out reinstates coverage. Added by Endorsement #2, this exclusion bars coverage for **Loss** in connection with a **Claim** based on any **Wrongful Act** first committed before January 7, 2021 `[policy.pdf, Page 19]`. The **Claim** alleges **Wrongful Acts** occurring during the Class Period of October 6, 2020, to February 3, 2021, which is largely prior to January 7, 2021 `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`. However, the exclusion contains a specific exception for "**Loss** in connection with a **Securities Claim**...made against any **Insured** based upon, arising out of, or attributable to any actual or alleged **Wrongful Act** committed or allegedly committed by Clover Health Investments, Corp. or any **Subsidiary** or **Insured Person** thereof" `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Clause 2]`. As this matter is a **Securities Claim** against the **Insureds**, this carve-out applies and coverage is not barred by this exclusion.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions**

*   **Exclusion C (Bodily Injury/Property Damage):** Not applicable. This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement #3, bars coverage for claims involving physical injury or property destruction but contains a carve-out for a **Securities Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section B, Clause 3]`.

*   **Exclusion D (Other Entity D&O Capacity):** Not applicable. The **Claim** alleges **Wrongful Acts** by the **Insured Persons** in their capacity with the **Company**, not another entity `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section III, Clause D]`.

*   **Exclusion E (ERISA):** Not applicable. This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement #3, pertains to violations of ERISA in connection with an employee benefit plan sponsored by the **Company**. The **Claim** does not allege such violations `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section B, Clause 4]`.

*   **Exclusion F (Prior or Pending Litigation):** Not applicable. This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement #2 and Endorsement #6, bars coverage for claims arising from litigation or circumstances pending as of the applicable **Prior or Pending Litigation Date**, which is June 1, 2014, or August 1, 2016, depending on the limit layer `[policy.pdf, Page 30]`. There is no indication in the **Claim** that the allegations were the subject of litigation pending prior to these dates.

*   **Exclusion G (Prior Notice):** Not applicable. This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement #3, bars coverage for claims arising from matters reported under a prior policy `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section B, Clause 5]`. There is no evidence this matter was previously reported.

*   **Exclusion H (Labor Law Violations):** Not applicable. This exclusion pertains to specific labor law violations in the context of a **Wrongful Employment Act**, which are not alleged in the **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section III, Clause H]`.

*   **Exclusion I (Insured vs. Insured):** Not applicable. The **Claim** is brought by third-party shareholders, not by or on behalf of the **Company** or another **Insured** `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Parties]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section III, Clause I]`.

*   **OFAC Exclusion (Endorsement #4):** Not applicable. Added by Endorsement #4, this exclusion bars coverage where it would violate economic sanctions `[policy.pdf, Page 28]`. This matter does not appear to involve any sanctioned parties or activities.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause:** This provision is potentially relevant. Section V.D. provides that for **Claims** other than a **Securities Claim**, the parties must use best efforts to allocate **Loss** between covered and uncovered parties or matters `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section V, Clause D]`. However, since the instant matter is a **Securities Claim**, this specific allocation clause does not apply by its own terms. Allocation may still be required pursuant to law if any portion of the **Loss** is determined to be uncovered.

*   **Defense and Settlement Clause:** This provision is applicable. The **Insurer** does not assume the duty to defend `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section V, Clause B]`. The **Insureds** must not admit liability, enter into any settlement, or incur **Defense Costs** without the **Insurer**'s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section V, Clause B]`. The **Insurer** has the right to associate in the defense and negotiation of any settlement `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section V, Clause C]`.

*   **Other Insurance Clause:** This provision is applicable. Section VII.H., as amended by Endorsement #3, states that this policy is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance, unless such other insurance is expressly excess `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section D, Clause 2]`. It is specifically excess to any policy for bodily injury, property damage, cyber liability, or fiduciary liability `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section D, Clause 2]`.

*   **Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause:** This provision is relevant as Clover Health Investments, Corp. was acquired by Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 2]`. The definition of **Company** includes the **Parent Organization** and its **Subsidiaries** `[policy.pdf, Page 4, Section II, Clause C]`. The policy was issued to the post-merger entity. The definition of **Subsidiary** and the Change in Control clause `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section VII, Clause B]` would govern the status of entities involved and the continuation of coverage.
# Conclusion

Based upon the foregoing analysis of the provided documents, there is a clear potential for coverage for the **Claim** under the Policy. The submission constitutes a **Securities Claim** alleging a **Wrongful Act** against parties who qualify as **Insureds**, and the **Claim** was first made and reported in a timely manner. The damages sought, including **Defense Costs**, fall within the Policy's definition of **Loss**. While the Past Acts exclusion is implicated by the timing of the alleged conduct, a specific carve-out for **Securities Claims** appears to preserve coverage. Consequently, a duty to advance **Defense Costs**, excess of the applicable **Retention**, has been triggered.

This preliminary coverage position is, however, subject to a full reservation of rights. The **Insurer** specifically reserves its rights under Exclusions A (Illegal Remuneration/Profit) and B (Deliberate Fraud), which may apply pending a final, non-appealable adjudication adverse to the **Insureds**. A reservation of rights is also maintained as to the definition of **Loss**, to the extent any potential settlement or judgment includes amounts constituting disgorgement, restitution, fines, or penalties. The investigation of this matter is ongoing, and this position is subject to modification as additional facts are developed.
