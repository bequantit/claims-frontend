## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The **Insurer**'s obligations under the primary D&O **Policy** form are delineated as follows:

> A. The **Insurer** will pay on behalf of the **Insured Persons**, **Loss** in excess of the applicable Retention resulting from **Claims** first made during the **Policy Period** against the **Insured Persons** for which the **Insured Persons** are legally obligated to pay for **Wrongful Acts**, except for **Loss** which the **Company** pays as indemnification. `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section I, Clause A]`
> B. The **Insurer** will pay on behalf of the **Company**, **Loss** in excess of the applicable Retention resulting from **Claims** first made during the **Policy Period** against the **Insured Persons** for which the **Company** has agreed to or is legally permitted or required by law to indemnify the **Insured Persons** for **Wrongful Acts**. `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section I, Clause B]`

Additionally, the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement provides entity coverage:

> The **Insurer** will pay on behalf of the **Company**, **Loss** in excess of the applicable Retention resulting from **Claims** first made during the **Policy Period** against the **Company** for which the **Company** is legally obligated to pay for **Wrongful Acts**. `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section I]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The submitted Complaint satisfies the definition of a **Claim** under the **Policy**.
    The **Policy**, as amended by Endorsement Form 3660, defines a **Claim** as, inter alia, "a civil proceeding commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading" against an **Insured Person** or the **Company** for a **Wrongful Act** `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause B]`. The matter at hand is a civil action initiated by a Complaint `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`, which squarely falls within this definition. The Entity Errors and Omissions Endorsement contains a substantially similar definition of **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause B]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the Complaint partially qualify as **Insureds** under the **Policy**.
    The Named Insured is Bancorp Rhode Island, Inc. and several other entities, including Bank Rhode Island `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 1]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Item 1]`. The Complaint names "Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. d/b/a BankRI" as a defendant `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 5]`. This entity qualifies as the **Company** under the **Policy** `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section III, Clause C]` and is an insured party under the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section I]`.
    The Complaint also names two individuals as defendants: Bernard LaBush and Stevan H. LaBush `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Numbers 6-7]`. The **Policy** defines **Insured Person** as "any past, present or future director, trustee, officer, **Employee** or honorary and/or advisory director or trustee of the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause E]`. The Complaint alleges that Bernard LaBush and Stevan H. LaBush were accountants retained by the plaintiffs and did business as LaBush and Company `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 11]`. There is no information within the provided documents to suggest that Bernard LaBush or Stevan H. LaBush were directors, officers, or **Employees** of the **Company**. Consequently, they do not appear to qualify as **Insured Persons** under the **Policy**. The claims asserted against them (Counts XII through XVII) are not subject to coverage. Further information would be required to confirm their relationship, if any, with the **Company**.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The Complaint alleges **Wrongful Acts** as defined by the **Policy**.
    The **Policy** defines **Wrongful Act** as "any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty by: (1) any **Insured Person** acting solely in the capacity as such" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause L]`. The Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement defines **Wrongful Act** more broadly as "any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty by the **Company** or by any person or entity for which the **Company** is legally responsible" `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause L]`. The Complaint alleges, inter alia, mismanagement, breach of contract, negligence, and failure to use due care by BankRI in the servicing of the plaintiffs' accounts, which enabled an embezzlement scheme `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 11, Number 52]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 13, Number 71]`. These allegations constitute **Wrongful Acts** as defined in the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was first made during the **Policy Period** and timely reported.
    For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The **Policy Period** is from June 1, 2005, to June 1, 2008 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 2]`. The Complaint is dated May 2008, and for the purpose of this analysis, the **Claim** is considered first made on May 5, 2008. This date falls within the **Policy Period**. The **Policy**, as modified by Endorsement Form 4572, requires notice "as soon as practicable... but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the end of the **Policy Year** in which such **Claim** is made" `[policy.pdf, Page 60, Section VII, Clause A]`. The **Claim** was reported on May 7, 2008, which is within the required timeframe.

Based on the foregoing analysis, the matter constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against the **Company**, first made and reported during the **Policy Period**. However, coverage appears to be limited to the defendant **Company**, Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc., as the individual defendants, Bernard LaBush and Stevan H. LaBush, do not qualify as **Insured Persons** based on the available information. Therefore, a potential for coverage exists under the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The damages sought in the Complaint partially fall within the **Policy's** definition of **Loss**.

The Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement defines **Loss** as:

> any amount which the **Company** is legally obligated to pay for a **Claim**, including **Defense Costs**, damages, judgments, settlements, pre- and post-judgment interest, punitive or exemplary damages and the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award where insurable by law, except **Loss** shall not include:
> (1) criminal or civil fines or penalties imposed by law; or
> (2) taxes; or
> (3) any unpaid, unrecoverable or outstanding credit extended to any customer; or
> (4) matters which are uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Endorsement shall be construed; or
> (5) other than **Defense Costs**, that portion of **Loss** that the **Company** is obligated to pay pursuant to any express oral or written contract or agreement existing prior to the date the **Claim** is made. `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause G]`

The plaintiffs demand compensatory damages in excess of $2,000,000 for the failure of their business `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]` and disgorgement of the embezzled funds of over $500,000 `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 19]`. They also seek payment of attorneys' fees and costs `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Number 4]`. The demand for attorneys' fees and compensatory damages may constitute covered **Loss**, subject to other policy terms. However, certain elements of the demanded relief may not be covered.

Specifically, the demand for declaratory relief that the $250,000 Debt is void `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Number 3]` may be construed as a demand for restitution or disgorgement of an unpaid debt, which could be excluded from the definition of **Loss** under clause (3) as "any unpaid, unrecoverable or outstanding credit extended to any customer" `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause G]`. Furthermore, claims arising from breach of contract (Counts I, II, III, IV, V) `[claim.pdf, Pages 11-13]` may be excluded from the definition of **Loss**, other than for **Defense Costs**, by clause (5), to the extent the **Company** is obligated to pay pursuant to a contract `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause G]`. 

At this preliminary stage, the full scope and nature of the damages are not fully delineated. Therefore, a reservation of rights is warranted regarding the extent to which the damages sought constitute covered **Loss** under the **Policy**.

### 3. Related Claims

There is no information within the provided documents to suggest the existence of any prior **Claim** or notice of circumstances that would trigger the **Policy's** provisions concerning **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section V, Clause C]`.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following exclusions from the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement (Form 6195) have been analyzed for their applicability to the **Claim**:

*   **Contractual Obligation Exclusion (N):** This exclusion is applicable. The exclusion, added by Endorsement Form 6195, provides that the **Insurer** is not liable for **Loss** in connection with any **Claim** arising from "the intentional breach in fact of any express oral or written contract or agreement between contracting parties" `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause N]`. The Complaint explicitly pleads claims for breach of written contract, oral contract, implied-in-fact contract, and contract by estoppel (Counts I, II, III, and IV) `[claim.pdf, Pages 11-13]`. These allegations fall directly within the purview of this exclusion. Furthermore, the definition of **Loss** in this endorsement excludes, other than for **Defense Costs**, amounts the **Company** is obligated to pay pursuant to a contract `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause G]`. Accordingly, any liability for damages arising from these contract-based counts appears to be excluded, though **Defense Costs** associated with them may be covered.
*   **Fraud Exclusion (D):** This exclusion is potentially applicable, subject to a final adjudication. The exclusion, as modified by Endorsement Form 6195, bars coverage for **Loss**, other than **Defense Costs**, for a **Claim** involving a "fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act" but applies only if established by a "judgment or other final adjudication" `[policy.pdf, Page 37, Section IV, Clause D]`. The Complaint alleges intentional conduct, such as "intentional infliction of emotional distress" (Count IX) `[claim.pdf, Page 15]` and "intentionally and maliciously interfered with the advantageous relationships" (Count VII) `[claim.pdf, Page 14]`. Should a final adjudication establish that the **Company's** conduct was fraudulent or dishonest, this exclusion would apply to preclude indemnity for any resulting judgment. A reservation of rights is appropriate pending final adjudication.
*   **Illegal Profit or Payment Exclusion (E):** This exclusion is potentially applicable, subject to a final adjudication. The exclusion, as modified by Endorsement Form 6195, bars coverage for **Loss**, other than **Defense Costs**, for a **Claim** involving the **Company** "gaining any profit, remuneration, or financial advantage to which they were not legally entitled," contingent upon a "judgment or other final adjudication" `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause E]`. The Complaint alleges unjust enrichment (Count X) `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Number 83]`. If it is finally adjudicated that the **Company** gained an illegal profit or advantage, such as through the collection of interest on the disputed debt, this exclusion would preclude indemnity for that portion of the **Loss**.
*   **Legal Lending Limit Exclusion (V):** This exclusion is potentially applicable. Added by Endorsement Form 6195, this exclusion precludes **Loss** for any **Claim** arising from an "extension of credit which was, at the time of its making, in excess of the legal lending limit of the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 40, Section IV, Clause V]`. The Complaint centers on unauthorized draws against a $250,000 line of credit `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 24]`. While the Complaint does not allege a violation of the legal lending limit, further factual development is necessary to determine if the transactions at issue exceeded the **Company's** statutory lending limits, which would trigger this exclusion.
*   **Bodily Injury and Property Damage Exclusion (A):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Prior Notice Exclusion (H):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Prior and Pending Litigation Exclusion (I):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Subsidiary Past Acts Exclusion (K):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Brokerage/Advisory Services Exclusion (L):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Bonding Company Exclusion (M):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **ERISA Bankruptcy Exclusion (O):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Failure to Collect Contribution/Benefits Exclusion (P):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Failure to Maintain Insurance Exclusion (Q):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Insider Loan Exclusion (R):** This exclusion was deleted by Endorsement Form 4506 `[policy.pdf, Page 55]`.
*   **Insolvency Exclusion (S):** This exclusion was deleted by Endorsement Form 4506 `[policy.pdf, Page 53]`.
*   **Insurance Operations Exclusion (T):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Internet Services Exclusion (U):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Safe Deposit Box Exclusion (W):** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Trust Operations Exclusion (X):** This exclusion is not applicable.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause**: This clause is applicable. Section IX (B) of the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement governs allocation where a **Claim** involves both covered and uncovered matters, requiring allocation based on the "relative legal exposures" `[policy.pdf, Page 42, Section IX, Clause B]`. Given that the **Claim** involves both tort (e.g., negligence) and contract allegations, and the contract claims may be excluded from indemnity, allocation of **Loss** and **Defense Costs** between covered and uncovered matters will be necessary.
*   **Defense and Settlement Clause**: This clause is applicable. The **Policy** is a no-duty-to-defend contract, requiring the **Insureds** to defend **Claims** `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section VI, Clause A]`. The **Insureds** must obtain the **Insurer's** prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, before settling any **Claim** or incurring **Defense Costs** `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section VI, Clause A]`.
*   **Other Insurance Clause**: This clause is applicable. Section IX (J) provides that this **Policy** is excess to other existing insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section IX, Clause J]`. Inquiry should be made as to whether the **Company** maintains any other potentially applicable insurance.
*   **Order of Payments**: This clause, added by Endorsement Form 7988, is applicable. It dictates that in the event **Loss** is likely to exceed the Limit of Liability, the **Insurer** shall first pay **Loss** covered under Insuring Agreement A (non-indemnified **Loss** for **Insured Persons**), then Insuring Agreement B (indemnified **Loss** for **Insured Persons**), and finally **Loss** covered for the **Company** `[policy.pdf, Page 67, Section V, Clause F]`. This provision is relevant to prioritizing payments if the **Claim** develops and implicates the D&O insuring agreements.
## Conclusion

Based upon the analysis set forth herein, there is a potential for coverage under the **Policy**, specifically under the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement, for the **Claim** asserted against the **Company**, Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. The Complaint constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** first made and reported within the **Policy Period**. However, the individual defendants, Bernard LaBush and Stevan H. LaBush, do not appear to qualify as **Insured Persons**, and therefore, coverage is not afforded for the claims asserted against them.

The coverage position is subject to a significant reservation of rights. Potential coverage issues include, but are not limited to, the applicability of the Contractual Obligation Exclusion to a substantial portion of the allegations, the potential future application of the Fraud and Illegal Profit exclusions pending final adjudication, and the proper allocation of **Loss** and **Defense Costs** between covered and uncovered matters and parties. This preliminary position may be revised as additional facts are developed and legal proceedings advance.
