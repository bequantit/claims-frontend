### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The primary allegations against Defendant BankRI constitute a series of alleged Wrongful Acts, including, inter alia, gross mismanagement in the servicing of the Plaintiffs' commercial accounts `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 1]`. Specifically, BankRI is alleged to have negligently permitted an unauthorized employee of the Plaintiff, one Rhonda Hastings, to execute unauthorized borrowings from a commercial line of credit totaling $250,000 `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraphs 23-24]`. This was purportedly enabled through internet banking access that was never authorized by the Plaintiffs `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraphs 26-27]`. Further, BankRI and its employee, Ms. Laurie Bruyere, allegedly failed to act upon or report numerous indicia of suspicious activity, including approximately 950 overdrafts in a thirteen-month period, which was a stark deviation from the Plaintiffs' historical banking patterns `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 20]`, thereby enabling the continuation of an embezzlement scheme that resulted in losses exceeding $500,000 `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 19]`. Subsequent to the discovery of the malfeasance, BankRI is alleged to have refused to take corrective action, specifically by declining to forgive the unlawfully incurred debt and refusing to release its first position lien on EMC's assets, which prevented EMC from obtaining necessary alternative financing and directly caused the failure of its business `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 31]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Paragraphs 36, 42]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Paragraph 43]`.

### Relief Sought
The Plaintiffs formally demand multiple forms of relief from the Honorable Court. They seek an order compelling the Defendants to pay monetary damages sustained as a consequence of the alleged violations of law `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Paragraph 1]`. The Plaintiffs also petition for declaratory relief, specifically a judicial determination of the legal rights and duties between the parties concerning the $250,000 debt, BankRI's security interest, and Pietrantonio's personal guarantee `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Paragraph 2]`. This includes a declaration that said debt and guarantee are void and without legal force or effect `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Paragraph 3]`. Additionally, the Plaintiffs demand the costs of the action and reasonable attorney's fees `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Paragraph 4]` and any such further relief as the court deems equitable and just `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Paragraph 5]`. The complaint does not explicitly request punitive damages, fines, penalties, or the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.
