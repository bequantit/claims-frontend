- **Breach of Fiduciary Duties:** The Individual Defendants, in their capacity as directors and officers, are alleged to have breached their fiduciary duties of care and loyalty by engaging in self-dealing, acting in bad faith, and prioritizing their personal financial interests and those of Kenneth Abdalla's entities over the interests of the Association and its members `[claim.pdf, Page 81, Paragraph 337]`.

### References to Related Claims
The Third Amended Complaint makes explicit reference to prior litigation involving the parties, which may bear upon the analysis of relatedness under the policy. Specifically, it references `Argentum Special Holdings, LLC et al. v. Union Square Owner’s Association, et al. (Case No. 140500083)`, an action wherein Kenneth Abdalla, as a majority interest holder, purported to direct the Association to make several stipulations against its own interest, including waiving a jury trial, admitting to willful and intentional wrongful acts, and stipulating that it breached its fiduciary duty `[claim.pdf, Page 61, Paragraph 245]`. The complaint also mentions a lawsuit filed by the Association and Malibu PM against a former owner, Ms. Louise Stark, which was subsequently dismissed as to her at Kenneth Abdalla's direction to facilitate his acquisition of her unit `[claim.pdf, Page 52, Paragraph 211]`.
