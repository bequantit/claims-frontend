### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegations articulate a multifaceted and deliberate scheme orchestrated by Defendant Kenneth Abdalla, effectuated through his control of the Association's Management Committee and various related entities, to systematically depress the value of the condominium units for his personal financial gain `[claim.pdf, Page 3, N/A]`. These alleged Wrongful Acts include, inter alia: the misappropriation and theft of Association funds for the payment of personal and commercial expenses unrelated to the Association `[claim.pdf, Page 4, N/A]`; the depletion of Association operating and reserve accounts `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Paragraphs 83-89]`; the manipulation of Association budgets to improperly allocate expenses and dramatically increase assessments for the Shared Interest Unit Owners `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Paragraph 92]`; directing the Association to neglect its duties, such as the failure to pay property taxes `[claim.pdf, Page 35, Paragraph 129]` and maintain adequate insurance `[claim.pdf, Page 40, Paragraph 152]`; gross mismanagement leading to the deterioration of the property and reduction of services `[claim.pdf, Page 36, Paragraph 134]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 38, Paragraph 145]`; and the attempted unilateral amendment of the Association’s governing documents to retroactively exculpate the Individual Defendants from liability `[claim.pdf, Page 57-58, Paragraph 233.e]`. These actions are collectively characterized as severe breaches of fiduciary obligations and duties owed to the Association and its members `[claim.pdf, Page 3, N/A]`.
