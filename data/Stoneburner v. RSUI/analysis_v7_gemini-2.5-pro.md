## Policy Summary

Based upon the documents provided, the policy is issued by RSUI Indemnity Company `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 1]` to the **Insured**, THE UNION SQUARE OWNER'S ASSOCIATION `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 1]`. The policy number is NHP670118 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Policy Number]`. The **Policy Period** is from November 27, 2016 to November 27, 2017 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 2]`. The policy has an aggregate **Limit of Liability** of $2,000,000 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 3]`.

## Coverage Analysis

The policy form is identified as RSG 211003 0609 - DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY POLICY - NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION - 2009 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 6]`. The following analysis is predicated on the assumption that the provided documents contain all pertinent policy terms, conditions, definitions, and exclusions necessary for a comprehensive review. Should the policy form RSG 211003 0609 or any unattached endorsements contain conflicting or additional provisions, this analysis would be subject to modification.

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The Insuring Agreements of the policy have not been provided in the policy documentation. The Declarations Page specifies differing **Retentions** for Insuring Agreements A, B, and C `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 4]`, which implies their existence. Pursuant to the instructions provided, Insuring Agreement A pertains to non-indemnified **Loss**, Insuring Agreement B pertains to indemnified **Loss**, and Insuring Agreement C pertains to **Loss** of the **Insured Entity**. As it is not confirmed that the **Insured Entity** is unable to indemnify the **Individual Insureds**, the analysis proceeds with the initial position that Insuring Agreement B is the primary insuring agreement triggered for claims against the **Individual Insureds**. Claims asserted directly against the **Insured Entity** would be analyzed under Insuring Agreement C.

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The policy documentation provided does not contain a definition for the term **Claim**. However, the legal action presented, namely the "THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT" `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`, which is a civil proceeding seeking monetary damages and other relief `[claim.pdf, Pages 95-101]`, constitutes a demand that would satisfy a standard definition of **Claim** in a Directors and Officers Liability Policy. Therefore, it is probable that the matter constitutes a **Claim** under the policy.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the **Claim** likely qualify as **Insureds** under the policy. The **Policyholder** is THE UNION SQUARE OWNER'S ASSOCIATION `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 1]`. The defendants named in the caption of the complaint include the Union Square Owners Association, Inc. (the "Association"), and several individuals identified as past members of the Association’s Management Committee and officers, including Kenneth Abdalla (President), Kay “Kitty” Stoneburner (Secretary), Cory Abdalla, John Sears, David Arms, Jim Mikula, Paul Benson, and Nicholas F. Klein `[claim.pdf, Page 2]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 3]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Number 18]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Number 19]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Number 20]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Number 21]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Number 22]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Number 23]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Number 24]`, `[claim.pdf, Pages 20-21, Number 81]`. A standard definition of **Insured Person** would include any past, present, or future director, officer, or committee member of the **Insured Entity**. Accordingly, these **Individual Defendants** likely qualify as **Insured Persons**. The Association itself, being the **Policyholder**, qualifies as an **Insured Entity**. The various other corporate defendants (the "Abdalla Entities") are not explicitly granted **Insured** status, and their coverage would depend on whether the policy defines **Insured** to include subsidiaries or other managed entities. Further information may be required to confirm the status of all named entities, particularly Malibu Property Management, LC, given the "Coverage Extension - Property Managers" endorsement `[policy.pdf, Page 3]`, the text of which has not been provided.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The **Claim** alleges numerous **Wrongful Acts**. The policy documentation provided does not contain a definition of **Wrongful Act**. However, the complaint extensively alleges breaches of fiduciary duty `[claim.pdf, Page 81, Numbers 336-343]`, mismanagement `[claim.pdf, Page 3]`, misappropriation of funds `[claim.pdf, Pages 21-22, Numbers 82-91]`, conflicts of interest `[claim.pdf, Pages 86-88, Numbers 351-356]`, and other breaches of duties by the **Individual Defendants** in their capacities as members of the Association's Management Committee and as officers `[claim.pdf, Page 81, Number 337]`. These allegations fall squarely within what would be considered a standard definition of **Wrongful Act** in a Directors and Officers Liability Policy.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The claim was properly made and reported. The **Policy Period** is from November 27, 2016 to November 27, 2017 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 2]`. The **Claim** was first made on December 1, 2016 and reported to the insurer on December 2, 2016. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage.

Based on the foregoing analysis, the matter presented appears to constitute a **Claim** alleging **Wrongful Acts** by **Insureds** that was first made and reported during the **Policy Period**. Subject to the absence of the complete policy wording, the matter appears to trigger the insuring agreements.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The policy documentation provided does not contain a definition for the term **Loss**. A standard policy definition typically includes damages, judgments, settlements, and **Defense Costs**, but carves out certain items. The **Claim** seeks substantial monetary damages, including compensatory damages `[claim.pdf, Page 95, Number 1.a]`, punitive damages `[claim.pdf, Page 98, Number 7.e]`, prejudgment and post-judgment interest `[claim.pdf, Page 95, Number 1.b]`, and attorney fees and costs `[claim.pdf, Page 95, Number 1.c, 1.d]`. The complaint also requests relief in the form of disgorgement for unjust enrichment `[claim.pdf, Page 91, Number 370]` and conversion `[claim.pdf, Page 89, Number 357]`. 

Typically, punitive damages and amounts constituting disgorgement or restitution for unjust enrichment are excluded from the definition of **Loss**. Therefore, to the extent the Plaintiffs are successful in recovering such damages, those amounts would likely not be covered under the policy. The claim for compensatory damages and the incurrence of **Defense Costs** would likely fall within the definition of **Loss**. At this initial stage, the full scope of damages is not yet adjudicated, and a reservation of rights is appropriate regarding whether all amounts sought by the Plaintiffs constitute insurable **Loss**.

### 3. Related Claims

The complaint makes reference to prior litigation, specifically case no. 140500083 `[claim.pdf, Page 61, Number 245]` and case no. 160500219 `[claim.pdf, Page 53, Number 211]`. Furthermore, the complaint details a continuous and interrelated series of alleged **Wrongful Acts** commencing as early as 2012 `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 48]`. The policy likely contains a Claim Interrelation Clause that would deem all claims arising from the same, related, or continuous **Wrongful Acts** as a single **Claim** first made at the time the earliest such claim was made. The policy may also contain a Prior and/or Pending Litigation exclusion, which could be implicated. The date of the prior litigation is stated as case no. 140500083, which suggests a 2014 inception. The policy lists an endorsement entitled "Exclusion - Prior and or Pending Litigation Backdated" `[policy.pdf, Page 3]`, which could bar coverage for this matter if it is deemed related to litigation that was pending prior to a date specified in that endorsement. The text of said endorsement has not been provided.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The policy documentation provided does not contain the full text of the exclusions. The Supplemental Declarations page `[policy.pdf, Page 3]` lists several exclusionary endorsements. The applicability of these exclusions cannot be definitively determined without their text; however, based on their titles and the allegations in the **Claim**, a preliminary analysis is as follows:

**Potentially Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Prior and or Pending Litigation (Endorsement RSG 206071 0204):** This exclusion is likely applicable. The **Claim** makes reference to prior legal proceedings, including a case filed in 2014 (`case no. 140500083`) `[claim.pdf, Page 61, Number 245]`. The current **Claim** arises from a series of events that appear to be intrinsically linked to these prior disputes. If the allegations in the current **Claim** are found to be legally or factually related to litigation pending before the date specified in this endorsement, the entire **Claim** could be excluded from coverage. The text of this endorsement is required for a conclusive determination.
*   **Prior Acts (Endorsement RSG 206069 1009):** This exclusion may be applicable. The **Claim** alleges a continuous course of misconduct commencing in approximately 2012 `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 48]`, well before the policy's inception date of November 27, 2016 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 2]`. This endorsement could preclude coverage for any **Wrongful Acts** that occurred prior to a specified date. The text of this endorsement is required for a conclusive determination.
*   **Conduct/Fraud:** A standard D&O policy contains an exclusion for fraudulent, criminal, or dishonest acts, or for acts where an **Insured** gained an improper personal profit or advantage. The **Claim** is replete with allegations of such conduct, including theft and misuse of funds `[claim.pdf, Page 4]`, self-dealing `[claim.pdf, Page 87, Number 352.a]`, conversion `[claim.pdf, Pages 89-90, Numbers 357-363]`, and unjust enrichment `[claim.pdf, Pages 91-92, Numbers 370-377]`. Such exclusions are typically subject to a "final, non-appealable adjudication" proviso, meaning the exclusion does not apply to preclude a defense until such a finding is made. A reservation of rights is required on this basis.
*   **Amended Bodily Injury and Property Damage (Endorsement RSG 216014 0609):** This exclusion may be partially applicable. The **Claim** alleges damage to property, such as units flooding `[claim.pdf, Page 36, Number 135]` and disrepair of the building `[claim.pdf, Page 37, Number 141]`. To the extent any damages sought constitute property damage as defined in the policy, this exclusion could apply. The text of the endorsement is needed to assess its scope and any carve-outs.
*   **Builder Developer (Endorsement RSG 206051 1214):** The applicability of this exclusion is uncertain without its text but could be relevant given the nature of the property, although the core allegations relate to management rather than construction or development defects.

**Not Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Exclusion - Employment Practices Claim (Endorsement RSG 206057 0808):** Not applicable. The **Claim** does not allege any employment-related wrongdoing.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

The following provisions, while not fully provided, are identified on the Declarations or Supplemental Declarations page `[policy.pdf, Pages 1, 3]` and are relevant:

**Amended Settlement Provision (Endorsement RSG 204160 1210):** This provision will govern the Insurer's and the **Insured's** rights and obligations concerning the settlement of any **Claim**. It likely requires the Insurer's prior written consent for any settlement.

**Full Severability (Endorsement RSG 214044 0204), Severability of All Exclusions (Endorsement RSG 204144 0407), and Severability of the Entity (Endorsement RSG 214049 0407):** These endorsements are highly relevant. They provide that the wrongful conduct or knowledge of one **Insured** will not be imputed to another **Insured** for the purpose of applying exclusions or rescinding coverage. This is critical given the allegations against numerous **Individual Defendants**.
## Conclusion

Based upon the preliminary analysis of the provided documentation, there is **potential coverage** for the **Claim**. The matter appears to allege **Wrongful Acts** by **Insureds** and was made and reported within the **Policy Period**. Therefore, the policy is triggered, and the Insurer has a duty to defend the **Claim**, subject to a full reservation of rights.

The reservation of rights is necessitated by several critical issues. Principally, the potential applicability of the Prior and/or Pending Litigation and Prior Acts exclusions `[policy.pdf, Page 3]` presents a significant coverage defense that may ultimately preclude all coverage, given the **Claim's** relationship to pre-policy events and litigation `[claim.pdf, Page 61, Number 245]`. Furthermore, a reservation is required regarding the definition of **Loss**, as certain components of the damages sought, such as punitive damages and disgorgement, may not be covered `[claim.pdf, Page 98, Number 7.e]`. A reservation is also warranted pending a final adjudication on the allegations of fraudulent and self-serving conduct `[claim.pdf, Page 89, Number 358]`. This initial position is expressly conditioned upon a review of the complete policy form and all applicable endorsements, which were not fully provided.
