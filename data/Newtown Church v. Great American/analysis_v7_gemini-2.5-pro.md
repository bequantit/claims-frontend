## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

> A. If during the **Policy Period** or the **Discovery Period** any **Claim** is first made against any **Insured Persons** for a **Wrongful Act**, the **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Persons**, **Loss** and **Costs of Defense** resulting from such **Claim**, except for any **Loss** and **Costs of Defense** which the **Organization** or any **Subsidiary** actually pays as indemnification. `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Section I, Clause A]`
> B. If during the **Policy Period** or the **Discovery Period** any **Claim** is first made against any **Insured Persons** for a **Wrongful Act**, the **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Organization** or any **Subsidiary**, **Loss** and **Costs of Defense** resulting from such **Claim**, but only to the extent the **Organization** or any **Subsidiary** is required or permitted by law to indemnify the **Insured Persons**. `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Section I, Clause B]`
> C. If during the **Policy Period** or the **Discovery Period** any **Claim** is first made against the **Organization** or any **Subsidiary** for a **Wrongful Act**, the **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Organization** or any **Subsidiary**, **Loss** and **Costs of Defense** resulting from such **Claim**. `[policy.pdf, Page 3, Section I, Clause C]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The instant matter satisfies the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The policy defines a **Claim** to include "a civil proceeding...made against any **Insured** seeking monetary or non-monetary (including injunctive) relief commenced by service of a complaint or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 4, Section III, Clause A(2)]`. The matter at hand is a civil Complaint `[claim.pdf, Page 1]` filed against the defendants seeking declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and money damages `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 9]`, thereby meeting the definition of a **Claim**.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the Complaint potentially qualify as **Insureds** under the policy. The policyholder is the **Organization** named in Item 1 of the Declarations `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section III, Clause J]`, which is presumed to be the Newton Presbyterian Church ("NPC"). The defendants named in the Complaint are Garrett Smith, Carmen Aldinger, Anders Brownworth, Thomas DeVol, Harold Jones, Doris Kellom, Kristen Lucken, Roger Mark, Rosalind Picard, Daniel Romaine, Beatrice Yankey, and The Newton Covenant Church ("NCC") `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The policy defines **Insured Persons** to include "all persons who were, now are, or shall be directors, trustees, officers...employees...volunteers or staff members of the **Organization**" `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section III, Clause H]`. Defendant Garrett Smith is identified as a "former staff member of NPC" `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 12]`. The other individual defendants are identified as "former member[s] of NPC" who now serve on the "Leadership Team" of NCC `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Numbers 14-23]`. While these individuals are described as "former members," their alleged leadership roles within the break-away faction, which previously constituted the NPC session `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 57]`, may qualify them as former trustees or officers. Further information is required to confirm their exact prior capacities with NPC. The defendant entity, The Newton Covenant Church, is alleged to be a new entity founded by former members of NPC `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 13]` and would not independently qualify as an **Insured** **Organization** or **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section III, Clauses J, P]`. However, allegations against NCC are tied directly to the actions of the individual defendants.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The Complaint alleges **Wrongful Acts** as defined by the policy. A **Wrongful Act** is defined, inter alia, as an "actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act or omission, neglect or breach of duty" by any **Insured Persons** acting in their capacity with the **Organization** `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Section III, Clause R(1)(a)]`. The Complaint alleges that the individual defendants, in their capacity as leaders of a faction within NPC, exerted "unlawful dominion and control over the property of NPC" `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 8]`, conducted an unauthorized vote to disaffiliate `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 5]`, assumed control over NPC's bank accounts making unauthorized payments `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 8]`, and took over NPC's website `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 8]`. These allegations of trespass and conversion constitute alleged breaches of duty `[claim.pdf, Page 20, Number 83]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Number 87]` and fall squarely within the definition of a **Wrongful Act**.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** appears to have been timely made and reported. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. Pursuant to the policy, a **Claim** must be first made during the **Policy Period** and reported to the **Insurer** "as soon as practicable...and in no event later than ninety (90) days after the end of the **Policy Year**" `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section VII, Clause A]`. The Complaint is dated March 17, 2017 `[claim.pdf, Page 23]`, and notice was provided to the **Insurer** on March 20, 2017. Assuming this date falls within the **Policy Period**, the notice provisions appear to be satisfied.

In summation, the Complaint constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against parties who likely qualify as **Insured Persons**. Assuming the **Claim** was made during the **Policy Period**, the insuring agreements are potentially triggered, subject to all other terms, conditions, and exclusions of the policy.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The policy defines **Loss** as:

> settlements, judgments, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, front and back pay, compensatory damages, punitive or exemplary damages, the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award, and subject to the provisions of Section V and VI, **Costs of Defense** incurred by the **Insured**. `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section III, Clause I]`

The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, damages for trespass and conversion, costs, interest, and attorneys' fees `[claim.pdf, Page 22]`. The claims for money damages resulting from the alleged trespass and conversion `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Clauses (c), (d)]` would constitute compensatory damages and potentially fall within the definition of **Loss**. **Costs of Defense** incurred in defending against these allegations would also be included `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section III, Clause I]`. 

However, the definition of **Loss** explicitly excludes "criminal or civil fines or penalties imposed by law" `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section III, Clause I(1)]` and "any amounts which may be deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Policy shall be construed" `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section III, Clause I(3)]`. The cost of complying with any injunctive relief, such as vacating the property, would likely not be considered **Loss**, as it is an obligation to perform an act rather than pay money damages. The policy also excludes from **Loss** non-monetary obligations, except for **Costs of Defense** `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause J(1)]`. At this preliminary stage, a reservation of rights is warranted regarding the characterization of any final judgment or settlement to ensure all components meet the policy's definition of **Loss**.

### 3. Related Claims

The provided documentation does not contain explicit reference to any prior claims that would constitute **Related Wrongful Acts** under the policy definition `[policy.pdf, Page 6, Section III, Clause O]`. Therefore, the Claim Interrelation Clause, which would deem multiple **Claims** involving **Related Wrongful Acts** as a single **Claim** made at the earliest date `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section V, Clause B]`, does not appear to be triggered at this time.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following exclusions may apply to the **Claim**:

*   **A. Conduct Exclusion:** This exclusion applies to **Claims** brought about or contributed to by any **Insured** gaining any profit or advantage to which they were not legally entitled, or by the deliberate fraudulent or criminal acts of any **Insured** `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Section IV, Clause A]`. The Complaint alleges the defendants engaged in an unlawful "land grab" `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Number 74]` and conversion of property and funds `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Number 87]`, which could be construed as gaining an illegal profit or advantage. This exclusion, however, is conditional and applies only upon a final adjudication that such conduct occurred `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Section IV, Clause A]`. Therefore, the **Insurer** should defend under a reservation of rights pending such an adjudication. 

*   **H. Insured vs. Insured Exclusion:** This exclusion applies to **Claims** brought "by, or for the benefit of, or at the behest of the **Organization** or any **Subsidiary**" `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause H]`. The plaintiffs in this action are the Newton Presbyterian Church and The Presbytery of Boston `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`. The Newton Presbyterian Church is the putative **Organization** under the policy. As such, this **Claim** is brought by the **Organization** against its former staff and leadership, who are **Insured Persons**. This exclusion appears to be directly applicable and may preclude coverage for the entirety of the **Claim**. There are no exceptions to this exclusion for derivative suits or other specific circumstances mentioned in the policy text. This exclusion provides a strong basis for denial of coverage.

*   **I. Contract Exclusion:** This exclusion applies to **Claims** for any actual or alleged breach by the **Organization** or any **Subsidiary** of an express or implied contract `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause I]`. The dispute is rooted in the defendants' alleged violation of the PCUSA Constitution, which the Complaint argues is binding on NPC and its members `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Number 31]`. If the relationship between the church and its members/officers is deemed contractual, this exclusion could potentially apply to aspects of the **Claim** arising from breach of those governing documents. However, the core allegations sound in tort (trespass, conversion) rather than pure contract breach, making the application of this exclusion less certain.

*   **J. Non-Monetary Relief / Unpaid Compensation Exclusion:** This exclusion applies, inter alia, to obligations to modify property or for relief in any form other than money damages (other than **Costs of Defense**) `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause J(1)]`. This would preclude coverage for the costs associated with complying with any injunctive relief, such as vacating the property `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Clause (b)]`. This exclusion is applicable to the non-monetary aspects of the prayer for relief.

The following exclusions are not applicable:

*   **B. Other Insurance:** Not applicable as there is no information about other policies `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Section IV, Clause B]`.

*   **C. Prior Notice / Prior Litigation:** Not applicable as there is no indication of prior notice or litigation `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause C]`.

*   **D. Bodily Injury / Property Damage:** Not applicable as the **Claim** is for economic loss, not bodily injury or damage to tangible property `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause D]`. 

*   **E. Statutory Violations (ERISA, etc.):** Not applicable as the **Claim** does not allege violations of the enumerated statutes `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause E]`.

*   **F. Outside Capacity:** Not applicable as the **Wrongful Acts** relate to the defendants' capacity with the **Organization**, not an unrelated entity `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause F]`.

*   **G. Pollution:** Not applicable as there are no allegations of pollution `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause G]`.

*   **K. Workers' Compensation:** Not applicable as this is not a **Claim** for workers' compensation or similar benefits `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section IV, Clause K]`.

*   **L. Professional Services:** Not applicable as the **Claim** does not arise from the performance of the enumerated professional services `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section IV, Clause L]`.

*   **M. Intellectual Property:** Not applicable as the allegations of taking over a website do not rise to the level of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section IV, Clause M]`.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

**Defense and Settlement Clause**: This clause requires the **Insureds** to obtain the **Insurer's** express written consent before incurring **Costs of Defense** or agreeing to any settlement `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section VI, Clause A]`. This is immediately relevant to the handling of the defense of this **Claim**.
## Conclusion

Based upon the foregoing analysis, coverage for this **Claim** should be **denied**. While the matter appears to satisfy the initial requirements of the Insuring Agreements by constituting a **Claim** for a **Wrongful Act** against **Insured Persons**, coverage is precluded by the policy's exclusions.

The primary and dispositive basis for denial is the Insured vs. Insured exclusion `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Section IV, Clause H]`. The **Claim** is brought by the Newton Presbyterian Church, which is the **Organization** under the policy, directly against its former staff and leadership. As the policy explicitly excludes coverage for claims brought "by, or for the benefit of, or at the behest of the **Organization**," and contains no applicable exceptions to this exclusion, there is no potential for coverage. This conclusion is definitive and warrants a denial of both defense and indemnity.
