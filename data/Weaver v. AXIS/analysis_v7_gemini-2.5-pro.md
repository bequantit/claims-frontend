## Policy Summary

Herein is provided a summary of the pertinent details of the policy of insurance issued by **Axis Surplus Insurance Company** `[policy.pdf, Page 20, N/A, N/A]` under Policy Number **ENN588818** `[policy.pdf, Page 20, N/A, N/A]`. The policy affords a **Limit of Liability** of $5,000,000 as the maximum aggregate for all **Loss** for all **Claim**(s) under all Insuring Agreements during the **Policy Period** `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Item 3, (A)]`. The applicable **Retentions** are $25,000 for each **Claim** under Insuring Agreement A and $25,000 for each **Claim** under Insuring Agreement D `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Item 4, (A)(i), (iv)]`. No **Retention** shall apply for non-indemnifiable **Loss** under Insuring Agreements A and D `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Item 4, (B)]`.

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

An analysis of the Insuring Agreements included in the policy is set forth below.

> The Insurer shall pay in connection with a **Wrongful Act** as appropriate per the Insuring Agreements below, which takes place before or during the **Policy Period**:
>
> DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CORPORATE LIABILITY
>
> (A) all **Loss** on behalf of any **Insured** arising from any **D&O Claim** for a **Wrongful Act**, other than a **Wrongful Act** while serving in an **Outside Position**, first made against such **Insured**;
>
> OUTSIDE EXECUTIVE LIABILITY
>
> (D) all **Loss** on behalf of any **Insured Individual** arising from any **D&O Claim** for a **Wrongful Act** while serving in an **Outside Position** first made against such **Insured Individual**;
>
> during the **Policy Period** or Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, and reported in writing to the Insurer as soon as practicable after any of the **Policyholder's** **Executive Officers** first becomes aware of such **Claim**, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the expiration of the **Policy Period** or Extended Reporting Period, if applicable.
`[policy.pdf, Page 34, Section I, (A) and (D)]`

The instant matter potentially triggers coverage under Insuring Agreement A. Insuring Agreement D is not implicated as there are no allegations that any **Insured Individual** was serving in an **Outside Position**. Pursuant to the governing principles of Directors and Officers liability insurance, coverage under Insuring Agreement A may apply on a non-indemnified basis (Side A) or an indemnified basis (Side B). Given that the matter is a criminal indictment, indemnification may be prohibited, which would implicate non-indemnified coverage. However, in the absence of definitive information regarding the **Policyholder's** ability or inability to indemnify the defendant **Insured Individuals**, this analysis will proceed under the presumption that the **Policyholder** is affording indemnification to the extent permitted by law.

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The submitted Indictment satisfies the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The policy defines a **D&O Claim**, in pertinent part, as "a criminal investigation or proceeding against any **Insured Individual** commenced by: (i) the return of an indictment, information, or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section III.B.2.c.(i)]`. The document submitted is an Indictment returned by a Grand Jury, which was filed on October 2, 2012 `[claim.pdf, Page 1, N/A]`. This action squarely falls within the definition of a **D&O Claim**.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the Indictment partially qualify as **Insureds** under the policy. The **Policyholder** is Multivend, LLC `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Item 1]`. The defendants named in the Indictment are Edward Morris “Ned” Weaver, Lawrence A. Kaplan, Scott M. Doumas, Mark Benowitz, Richard R. Goldberg, Richard Linick, Paul E. Raia, Howard S. Strauss, Wallace W. "Wally" DiRenzo, and James P. Ellis `[claim.pdf, Page 1, N/A]`. The policy defines **Insured Individual**, in pertinent part, as:

    > any one or more natural persons who are past, present or future: a. duly elected or appointed director(s), officer(s), trustee(s) or **Manager**(s) of the **Policyholder** or their functional equivalents if serving in such a position outside the United States;
    `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section III.B.4.a]`

    The Indictment identifies the following defendants and their roles at Vendstar (d/b/a Multivend, LLC):
    - Edward Morris “Ned” Weaver: president and chief executive officer `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 2]`. As president and CEO, he qualifies as an **Insured Individual**.
    - Lawrence A. Kaplan: technical support manager `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 3]`. His status as a **Manager** of the **Policyholder** qualifies him as an **Insured Individual**.
    - Scott M. Doumas: sales representative and sales manager `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 4]`. His status as a sales manager qualifies him as an **Insured Individual**.
    - Mark Benowitz, Richard R. Goldberg, Richard Linick, Paul E. Raia, and Howard S. Strauss: sales representatives `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 5]`. These individuals are not identified as holding director, officer, or **Manager** positions. They are identified as employees, but the definition of **Insured Individual** for a **D&O Claim** does not extend to all employees, only those named in a **D&O Claim** who are also a director, officer, or **Manager**. Therefore, based on the information provided, these individuals do not qualify as **Insured Individuals**.
    - Wallace W. "Wally" DiRenzo and James P. Ellis: operators of locating companies recommended by Vendstar `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Numbers 6, 7]`. These individuals are not alleged to be directors, officers, or **Managers** of the **Policyholder** and therefore do not qualify as **Insured Individuals**.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The Indictment sufficiently alleges **Wrongful Acts** as defined by the policy. A **Wrongful Act** is defined, in pertinent part, as "any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, or breach of duty by: (i) any **Insured Individual** in their capacity as such" `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section III.B.5.a.(i)]`. The Indictment alleges that the defendants, including the **Insured Individuals**, engaged in a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 2]`, made materially false statements and representations, and concealed material facts concerning the business opportunities sold by Vendstar `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Number 3]`. These allegations constitute alleged breaches of duty, misstatements, and fraudulent acts committed by the **Insured Individuals** in their capacities with the **Policyholder**, thus meeting the definition of a **Wrongful Act**.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was first made during the **Policy Period** and timely reported. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The Indictment was filed on October 2, 2012 `[claim.pdf, Page 1, N/A]`, which constitutes the date the **Claim** was first made. Endorsement No. 8 amended the **Policy Period** to run from February 20, 2010, to February 20, 2014 `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Item 2]`. As the **Claim** was first made on October 2, 2012, it falls within this amended **Policy Period**. The **Claim** was received by the Insurer on October 4, 2012, which is within the sixty (60) day reporting window following the expiration of the **Policy Period**, as required by the Insuring Agreements `[policy.pdf, Page 34, Section I]`. Therefore, the **Claim** was made and reported in accordance with the policy's terms.

Based on the foregoing analysis, the Indictment constitutes a **Claim** alleging a **Wrongful Act** that was first made and reported during the **Policy Period**. However, coverage is only afforded to those defendants who qualify as **Insured Individuals**. Therefore, a duty to defend is triggered for Edward Weaver, Lawrence Kaplan, and Scott Doumas, subject to all other terms, conditions, and exclusions of the policy.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The policy defines **Loss** as:
> the amount(s) which the **Insureds** become legally obligated to pay on account of a **Claim**, including damages, judgments, any award of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, settlement amounts, costs and fees awarded pursuant to judgments, and **Defense Costs**.
`[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III.A.7]`

The definition of **Loss** explicitly excludes "fines, penalties, or taxes imposed by law" `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III.A.7.a]` and "matters uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Policy shall be construed" `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III.A.7.b]`. The Indictment seeks criminal penalties, including imprisonment `[claim.pdf, Pages 32-41, N/A]`. While the Indictment does not explicitly seek monetary damages, it refers to a scheme to "obtain money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses" `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 2.a]`, which could lead to judgments for restitution or disgorgement. Such amounts, along with any fines or penalties that may be imposed upon a finding of guilt, would likely be excluded from the definition of **Loss**. **Defense Costs**, however, are explicitly included within the definition of **Loss**. At this nascent stage of the proceedings, the full scope of potential damages is not yet ascertained. Therefore, a reservation of rights is warranted with respect to the characterization of any ultimate monetary judgment or settlement, to determine if such amounts constitute covered **Loss**.

### 3. Related Claims
The instant Indictment does not contain any reference to prior legal proceedings, notices, or claims that would implicate the policy's provisions concerning **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III.A.6]`. Therefore, at present, this **Claim** stands as a single, unrelated matter.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

**Applicable Exclusions**

*   **Conduct Exclusion (Section IV.A.5.):** This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement No. 1, precludes coverage for **Loss** "based upon, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of or in any way involving: a. the gaining of any profit, remuneration, or advantage to which the **Insured** was not legally entitled; or b. any criminal or deliberately fraudulent act, error or omission by an **Insured**; if evidenced by any judgment, final adjudication or alternate dispute resolution proceeding" `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section IV A. 5]`. The Indictment alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to unlawfully enrich themselves through fraudulent means `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Number 3]` and committed mail and wire fraud `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 2]`. Should these allegations be proven and result in a final, non-appealable adjudication against an **Insured**, this exclusion would apply to preclude coverage for any resulting **Loss**, other than **Defense Costs** which will be advanced until such final adjudication. A reservation of rights will be issued on this basis.

*   **Prior Notice Exclusion (Section IV.A.1.):** This exclusion is not applicable as there is no indication that notice of this matter was given under a prior policy.

*   **Pending & Prior Claim Exclusion (Section IV.A.2.):** This exclusion is not applicable as the Indictment was filed on October 2, 2012 `[claim.pdf, Page 1, N/A]`, subsequent to the Pending and Prior **Claim** Date of February 20, 2008 `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Item 8]`, and does not arise from any matter pending prior to that date.

*   **Bodily Injury/Property Damage Exclusion (Section IV.A.3.):** This exclusion, as modified by Endorsement No. 1, is not applicable as the Indictment does not allege bodily injury or property damage `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section IV A. 3]`.

*   **Pollution Exclusion (Section IV.A.4.):** This exclusion is not applicable as the allegations are unrelated to **Pollutants** or Clean Up Costs `[policy.pdf, Page 43, Section IV, A.4]`.

*   **Insured vs. Insured Exclusion (Section IV.B.1.):** This exclusion is not applicable as the **Claim** is brought by the United States of America, an entity external to the **Insureds** `[claim.pdf, Page 1, N/A]`.

*   **ERISA Exclusion (Section IV.B.2.):** This exclusion is not applicable as the **Claim** does not involve any violation of ERISA or similar laws `[policy.pdf, Page 44, Section IV, B.2]`.

*   **Securities Exclusion (Section IV.B.3.):** This exclusion is not applicable. Although the matter involves fraud allegations, it pertains to the sale of business opportunities, not the offering, sale, or purchase of securities of the **Policyholder** `[policy.pdf, Page 45, Section IV, B.3]`.

*   **Third Party Claim Exclusion (Section IV.B.4.):** This exclusion is not applicable as the **Claim** is a **D&O Claim**, not a **Third Party Claim** for a **Wrongful Third Party Act** as those terms are defined `[policy.pdf, Page 45, Section IV, B.4]`.

*   **Side C Exclusions for Policyholder (Section IV.C.):** These exclusions (Intellectual Property, Contractual Liability, Professional Services) are not applicable as they apply only to claims against the **Policyholder** under Insuring Agreement A `[policy.pdf, Page 45, Section IV, C]`, and the current **Claim** is solely against individuals.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

**Allocation Clause**: Section V.C.4, as added by Endorsement No. 1, provides for the allocation of **Loss** between covered and uncovered matters or parties `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section V, C.4]`. This provision is highly relevant, as the **Claim** names both **Insured Individuals** and non-insured parties as defendants. An allocation of **Defense Costs** and any other potential **Loss** will be required between covered and uncovered parties.

**Defense and Settlement Clause**: Section V.C and V.D, as modified by Endorsements No. 1 and 2 respectively, govern defense and settlement. Endorsement No. 1 grants the **Insureds** the right to assume their own defense and select counsel with the Insurer's consent, and provides for the advancement of **Defense Costs** by the Insurer `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section V, C.1, 2, 3]`. Section V.D requires the Insurer's prior written consent for any settlement `[policy.pdf, Page 48, Section V, D]`. These provisions will govern the management of the defense and any potential resolution of this matter.

**Other Insurance Clause**: Section VIII.D provides that the policy is excess to other available insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section VIII, D]`. This is not currently applicable but should be noted in the event other policies are identified.

**Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause**: Section VIII.A is not relevant at this time as the **Claim** pertains solely to the named **Parent Company**, Multivend, LLC `[policy.pdf, Page 48, Section VIII, A]`.

### Conclusion

Upon preliminary review, there is **potential coverage** for the **Claim** presented, thereby triggering the Insurer's duty to defend, subject to a full reservation of rights. This position is predicated on the determination that the Indictment constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against certain **Insured Individuals**, which was first made and reported within the terms of the policy. Coverage is extended only to those defendants who meet the definition of an **Insured Individual**, namely Edward Weaver, Lawrence Kaplan, and Scott Doumas. A defense will not be afforded to the other named defendants who do not qualify as **Insureds**.

The initial coverage position is preliminary. A reservation of rights letter must be issued, articulating that coverage may be ultimately precluded by certain policy provisions, most notably the conduct exclusion for fraudulent or criminal acts, which is contingent upon a final adjudication. Furthermore, a reservation is necessary regarding the definition of **Loss**, as any fines, penalties, or amounts deemed uninsurable restitution or disgorgement will not be covered. Finally, given that the **Claim** involves both covered and uncovered parties, the allocation provision will apply to all **Loss**, including **Defense Costs**.
