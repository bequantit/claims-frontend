## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The **Insuring Agreements** provide as follows `[policy.pdf, Page 24, Section I, Clause A-C]`:

> (A) The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Persons** **Loss** resulting from a **Claim** first made against the **Insured Persons** during the **Policy Period** or, if applicable, the Optional Extension Period, for a **Wrongful Act**, **Employment Practices Wrongful Act**, **Fiduciary Wrongful Act** or **Professional Services Wrongful Act** except for **Loss** which the **Company** has paid on behalf of the **Insured Person** or has reimbursed the **Insured Person**, as indemnification.
> (B) The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the **Company** **Loss** which the **Company** is required or permitted to pay as indemnification to any of the **Insured Persons** resulting from a **Claim** first made against the **Insured Persons** during the **Policy Period** or, if applicable, the Optional Extension Period, for a **Wrongful Act**, **Employment Practices Wrongful Act**, **Fiduciary Wrongful Act** or **Professional Services Wrongful Act**.
> (C) The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the **Company** **Loss** resulting from any **Company Claim** first made against the **Company** during the **Policy Period** or, if applicable, the Optional Extension Period, for a **Company Wrongful Act**.

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The petition satisfies the Policy's definition of a **Claim**. The instant matter is a civil proceeding initiated by the filing of a Petition in the District Court of Oklahoma County, which constitutes a "civil proceeding in a court of law" `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Caption]`. The Policy defines **Claim** to include, inter alia, "any civil proceeding in a court of law or equity" `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section II, Clause C(4)]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the **Claim** document partially qualify as an **Insured**. The **Parent Company** is American Energy Partners, L.P. `[policy.pdf, Page 2, Item 1]`. The defendants named in the Petition are SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC; SCOOP Energy Company, LLC; Thomas J. Blalock, in his capacity as Personal Representative of the ESTATE OF AUBREY K. MCCLENDON; Thomas J. Blalock, individually; and Ryan A. Turner `[claim.pdf, Page 2, The Parties]`. The Policy defines **Insured** to mean the **Insured Persons** and the **Company** `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section II, Clause L]`. 
    *   **Thomas J. Blalock and Ryan A. Turner:** The Petition alleges Mr. Blalock was the Chief Legal Officer and Mr. Turner was the Chief Investment Officer of American Energy Partners, LP ("AELP") `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 9]`. The Policy defines **Insured Person** to include any "past, present or future employee, director, officer, manager...of the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section II, Clause M(1)]`. As former officers of the **Parent Company**, Mr. Blalock and Mr. Turner appear to qualify as **Insured Persons**.
    *   **SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC and SCOOP Energy Company, LLC:** The Policy defines **Company** to include the **Parent Company** and any **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section II, Clause D]`. **Subsidiary** is defined, in pertinent part, as any entity in which Aubrey K. McClendon or his estate has a direct or indirect ownership interest, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section II, Clause X]`. The Petition alleges the Estate of Aubrey K. McClendon is the majority owner of SCOOP Holdings `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 2]`, and SCOOP Holdings owns all membership interests in SEC `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 3]`. Accordingly, SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC and SCOOP Energy Company, LLC appear to qualify as part of the **Company** under the Policy.
    *   **Thomas J. Blalock, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Aubrey K. McClendon:** The Estate is not an **Insured** under the Policy. The **Claim** against Mr. Blalock in his capacity as Personal Representative of the Estate is for actions taken on behalf of the Estate, which is a separate legal entity and not an **Insured** under the Policy. Coverage for this capacity is not afforded.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The **Claim** alleges **Wrongful Acts** by the **Insureds**. The Policy defines **Wrongful Act** as "any matter asserted against, or investigated or inquired with respect to, an **Insured Person** by reason of his or her status as an **Insured Person**" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section II, Clause Y]`. The Petition alleges that Mr. Blalock and Mr. Turner, in their capacities as members of the Executive Management Team, entered into agreements and engaged in conduct related to their roles within the AELP enterprise `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 12]`, which led to the present dispute over profit sharing `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Numbers 58, 61]`. The **Claim** also alleges a **Company Wrongful Act**, defined as an "actual or alleged act, error, omission...or breach of duty by the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section II, Clause E]`, by alleging SCOOP Holdings and SEC breached a contractual obligation to distribute funds `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 60]`.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was timely made and reported. The **Claim** was first made on September 1, 2016, which falls within the **Policy Period** of August 27, 2016, to February 27, 2017 `[policy.pdf, Page 2, Item 2]`. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage.

Based upon the foregoing analysis, the **Claim** constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against **Insureds** first made during the **Policy Period**. Accordingly, the matter potentially triggers the Insuring Agreements of the Policy.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The Policy defines **Loss** as:

> damages, judgments, payments, settlements, relief or other amounts (including fines or penalties, taxes, punitive or exemplary damages, the multiplied portion of any damage award, where insurable by law, and any pre-judgment or post-judgment interest that is awarded on any judgment) and **Defense Expenses** in excess of the Retention that the **Insured** is legally obligated to pay. **Loss** will not include matters which are uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Policy is construed... `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section II, Clause P]`.

The Plaintiff seeks a declaration of rights, judgment for breach of contract, and the imposition of a resulting trust, all of which are intended to compel the distribution of profits from the sale of the SCOOP Assets `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Request for Relief]`. The damages are claimed to be the proceeds attributable to the Plaintiff's alleged 6% interest `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Number 62]`. This demand for payment appears to fall within the definition of **Loss**. The amounts sought are essentially compensatory damages for an alleged breach of contract. **Defense Expenses** incurred in defending the **Claim** would also constitute **Loss** `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section II, Clause F]`. The primary relief sought is the payment of funds allegedly owed to the Plaintiff. If characterized as restitution or disgorgement of funds to which the **Insureds** were never entitled, such amounts may not constitute **Loss**. However, at this preliminary stage, the amounts sought appear to be covered damages. A reservation of rights is appropriate pending further development of the nature of the damages sought.

### 3. Related Claims

There are no explicit references in the provided documents to any earlier **Claim** or written notice of circumstances that would trigger the **Interrelated Claims** provision of the Policy `[policy.pdf, Page 31, Section VI, Clause B]`. The instant matter appears to be the first **Claim** arising from these facts.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following Exclusions are contained within the Policy `[policy.pdf, Page 29-30, Section III]`:

**Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Exclusion (C) - Insured vs. Insured (IvI):** This exclusion bars coverage for any **Claim** brought "by, on behalf of, or at the direction of the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section III, Clause C]`. The Plaintiff, Scott Mueller, was the Chief Financial Officer of multiple McClendon-affiliated companies, including SEC and SCOOP Holdings `[claim.pdf, Page 6-7, Numbers 19, 23]`. As an officer, he qualifies as an **Insured Person** `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section II, Clause M(1)]`. Therefore, this **Claim** is brought by one **Insured Person** against other **Insured Persons** and the **Company**, potentially triggering the application of this exclusion. However, the exclusion does not apply to **Defense Expenses** `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section III, Clause C]`. Furthermore, the exclusion contains several carve-backs that do not appear immediately applicable, such as for derivative actions or claims by a bankruptcy trustee. A full analysis of this exclusion's applicability will require further factual development, but it presents a significant potential coverage defense for indemnity **Loss**.
*   **Exclusion (E) - Contractual Liability:** This exclusion precludes coverage "for any actual liability of the **Company** under any express contract or agreement" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section III, Clause E]`. This exclusion applies only to coverage provided under **INSURING AGREEMENT (C)**, which is Entity Coverage for a **Company Wrongful Act**. The Plaintiff's claims are explicitly based on the alleged breach of the ECOIA and subsequent oral and written agreements `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 58]`. The **Claim** against the defendant entities, SCOOP Holdings and SEC, is for their alleged obligation to distribute funds pursuant to these agreements `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Number 60]`. Therefore, this exclusion is applicable to preclude indemnity coverage for the **Company** under **Insuring Agreement (C)**. However, the exclusion explicitly does not apply to **Defense Expenses** `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section III, Clause E]`.
*   **Exclusion (B) - Conduct:** This exclusion applies to **Loss** brought about by any "intentionally dishonest, fraudulent or criminal act or omission or personal financial profit or remuneration gained by any **Insured** to which such **Insured** is not legally entitled" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section III, Clause B]`. Application of this exclusion requires a "final non-appealable adjudication in the underlying action" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section III, Clause B]`. While the allegations do not explicitly plead fraud, the dispute centers on entitlement to profit. Should there be a final adjudication that an **Insured** sought or retained a financial profit to which they were not legally entitled, this exclusion could apply to indemnity **Loss**. At this stage, a reservation of rights is warranted. The exclusion does not apply to **Defense Expenses** `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section III, Clause B]`.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Exclusion (A) - Prior Notice:** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Exclusion (D) - Outside/Joint Venture Entity:** This exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Exclusion (F) - Bodily Injury/Property Damage:** This exclusion is not applicable.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause:** The Policy contains a favorable allocation provision stating that if a **Claim** includes both covered and uncovered matters, "the **Insureds** and the Insurer shall allocate 100% of such amounts to covered **Loss**" `[policy.pdf, Page 31, Section V, Clause D]`. This provision substantially limits the Insurer's ability to allocate **Defense Expenses** between covered and uncovered parties or allegations.
*   **Defense and Settlement Clause:** The Policy provides that the **Insureds**, not the Insurer, have the duty to defend any **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 30, Section V, Clause A]`. The Insurer's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, is required for any settlement `[policy.pdf, Page 30, Section V, Clause B]`. The Insurer will advance **Defense Expenses** on a current basis, in excess of the applicable Retention `[policy.pdf, Page 31, Section V, Clause C]`.
*   **Other Insurance Clause:** The Policy provides that it is specifically excess of any other valid and collectible insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 32, Section VI, Clause C(1)]`.
*   **Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause:** This provision is relevant to confirming that SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC and SCOOP Energy Company, LLC are **Insureds** under the Policy, as analyzed above `[policy.pdf, Page 32, Section VI, Clause D]`.
## Conclusion

Based upon the preliminary review of the submitted **Claim** and the applicable Policy, there is potential for coverage under the Policy. The submission constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against parties who qualify as **Insureds**, and said **Claim** was first made during the **Policy Period**. Consequently, a duty to advance **Defense Expenses**, subject to the applicable Retention, is triggered. The Insurer should issue a reservation of rights letter acknowledging the potential for coverage while preserving all rights and defenses under the Policy.

This position is based on the significant coverage issues presented by the Insured vs. Insured Exclusion (Exclusion C) and the Contractual Liability Exclusion (Exclusion E). These exclusions, while not applying to **Defense Expenses**, may preclude coverage for any indemnity payment or settlement. The applicability of the Conduct Exclusion (Exclusion B) is also reserved pending a final adjudication. This initial coverage position is preliminary and subject to modification as further factual information is developed and legal analysis is conducted.
