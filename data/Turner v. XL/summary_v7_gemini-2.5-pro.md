## Scott R. Mueller v. SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC, et al.
### Submission Summary
This submission pertains to a Petition filed on September 1, 2016, in the District Court of Oklahoma County, State of Oklahoma, by Plaintiff Scott R. Mueller. The claim is asserted against SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC, SCOOP Energy Company, LLC, Thomas J. Blalock (in his individual capacity and as Personal Representative of the Estate of Aubrey K. McClendon), and Ryan A. Turner, concerning Plaintiff's alleged entitlement to a profit share from the sale of corporate assets based on purported contractual agreements.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
- **SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC:** A Delaware limited liability company identified as an insured corporate entity `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 2]`.
- **SCOOP Energy Company, LLC:** An Oklahoma limited liability company identified as an insured corporate entity `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 3]`.
- **Thomas J. Blalock, in his capacity as Personal Representative of the ESTATE OF AUBREY K. MCCLENDON:** An individual acting in a representative capacity for the estate of the deceased majority owner `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 4]`.
- **Thomas J. Blalock, individually:** An individual and member of the Executive Management Team `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 5]`.
- **Ryan A. Turner, individually:** An individual and member of the Executive Management Team `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 6]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegations forming the basis of the claim constitute an alleged Wrongful Act, specifically a breach of duty and neglect. Plaintiff avers that an enforceable agreement, evidenced by a written Equity and Co-Investment Agreement ("ECOIA") `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Paragraph 14]` and subsequent oral and written agreements with the deceased Aubrey K. McClendon `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Paragraph 27]`, established Plaintiff's right to a 6% share of the profits attributable to McClendon's 95% membership interest in SCOOP Holdings `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Paragraph 26]`. The alleged Wrongful Act is the failure and refusal by the Defendants, subsequent to the sale of the "SCOOP Assets," to distribute said 6% share to the Plaintiff, which is posited as a breach of contractual and other legal duties owed to him `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Paragraph 61]`.

### Relief Sought
The Plaintiff seeks several forms of relief from the Court:
- **Declaratory Judgment:** A judicial declaration affirming the contractual rights and duties of the parties, including a determination that Plaintiff and other members of the Executive Management Team are the rightful owners of their respective profit shares and that said shares do not constitute property of the McClendon Estate `[claim.pdf, Page 13, Paragraphs 53-54]`.
- **Monetary Damages:** For breach of contract, Plaintiff seeks damages equivalent to his 6% profit share, an amount alleged to exceed $75,000, along with pre-judgment and post-judgment interest `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Paragraph 62]`.
- **Equitable Relief (Resulting Trust):** In the alternative, Plaintiff requests the Court to impose a resulting trust upon the proceeds from the sale of the SCOOP Assets for the benefit of the Executive Management Team, compelling the distribution of their respective shares `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Paragraph 68]`.
- **Authorization to Distribute:** Plaintiff, in his capacity as the sole remaining officer of the SCOOP entities `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 47]`, seeks authorization from the Court to make distributions as determined by the Court, including the funding of an employee bonus pool `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 56]`.
The Petition does not explicitly seek relief in the form of fines, penalties, taxes, punitive or exemplary damages, or disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.

### Counts
- **Count I - Declaratory Judgment:** Plaintiff seeks a declaration of the contractual rights and duties of the parties pursuant to the alleged agreements `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Count I]`.
- **Count II - Breach of Contract:** Plaintiff alleges Defendants breached the ECOIA and subsequent agreements by withholding his profit share from the asset sale proceeds `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Count II]`.
- **Count III - Resulting Trust:** In the alternative, Plaintiff asserts that a resulting trust has arisen by operation of law over his 6% profit share held by McClendon `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Count III]`.

### References to Related Claims
The Petition makes reference to a related probate proceeding, `In The Matter of The Estate of Aubrey McClendon, Deceased`, Case No. PB-2016-342, pending in Oklahoma County `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 4]`. It is noted within said probate proceeding that certain creditors have objected to the distribution of profits to the Executive Management Team, effectively blocking such distributions, and have alleged a conflict of interest on the part of Defendant Blalock in his capacity as Personal Representative `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraphs 45-46]`. These allegations and objections in the probate matter are directly antecedent to the instant claim and bear upon the same subject matter and parties.
