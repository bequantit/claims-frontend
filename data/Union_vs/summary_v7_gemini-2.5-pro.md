### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegations constitute a comprehensive scheme by Defendant Kenneth Abdalla, acting in concert with the other Defendants, to misappropriate millions of dollars and systematically devalue the fractional interest units at the Sky Lodge Condominium Project for his personal financial gain `[claim.pdf, Pages 2-3]`. The alleged Wrongful Acts, constituting breaches of fiduciary duty, errors, omissions, and willful misconduct, include, inter alia:

*   **Financial Mismanagement and Misappropriation:** Deliberate depletion of the Association's operating and reserve funds, transferring over one million dollars from reserves to cover operating expenses and non-Association costs `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Paragraphs 84-89]`. The Association allegedly paid at least $2,703,669 in operational expenses for Mr. Abdalla's separate commercial entities `[claim.pdf, Page 64, Paragraph 262]`, and an additional $72,458 for personal legal fees and other expenses of his company, Malibu `[claim.pdf, Page 65, Paragraph 263]`.
*   **Improper Budgeting and Expense Allocation:** Intentionally shifting expenses from the Commercial Units (controlled by Abdalla) to the Shared Interest Unit Owners, resulting in a 281% increase in Shared Interest assessments over two years `[claim.pdf, Page 27, Paragraph 109]`. This involved misallocating costs for housekeeping, management, and even payroll for employees of Abdalla's separate businesses `[claim.pdf, Page 23, Paragraphs 94-96]`.
*   **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** The Individual Defendants, as members of the Association's Management Committee, acted in bad faith and contrary to the Association's best interests `[claim.pdf, Page 83, Paragraph 339]`. This included engaging in conflicted interest transactions, such as hiring Abdalla-controlled entities as property and rental managers without proper oversight `[claim.pdf, Page 20, Paragraph 78]`, and voting as puppet directors at Mr. Abdalla's direction `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Paragraph 71]`.
*   **Scheme to Devalue Property:** A concerted effort to drive down the value of units to facilitate their acquisition by Mr. Abdalla at substantially reduced prices `[claim.pdf, Page 3]`. Tactics included raising assessments to unsustainable levels, failing to pay property taxes, neglecting maintenance, reducing amenities, and frustrating independent sales of units `[claim.pdf, Pages 3-4]`.
*   **Improper Amendment of Governing Documents:** Unilaterally amending the Association's Declaration to benefit Mr. Abdalla, including a provision to retroactively eliminate liability for the Individual Defendants for their past misconduct `[claim.pdf, Page 57, Paragraph 233.e]`.

### Relief Sought
Plaintiffs seek a combination of monetary damages, equitable relief, and declaratory judgments. Specifically, the prayer for relief includes:

*   **Monetary Damages:** Damages in an amount to be proven at trial for all causes of action, with a specified minimum of $4,183,582 for claims of conversion and unjust enrichment `[claim.pdf, Page 90, Paragraph 362]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 92, Paragraph 376]`.
*   **Punitive Damages:** An award of punitive damages is sought against the Individual Defendants and Malibu PM for willful, malicious, and intentionally harmful conduct in their breach of fiduciary duties and aiding and abetting thereof `[claim.pdf, Page 84, Paragraph 342]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 86, Paragraph 349]`.
*   **Declaratory Judgment:** A declaration that the purported 2018 Amended and Restated Declaration of Condominium is void ab initio and unenforceable as it violates public policy and is unreasonable `[claim.pdf, Page 96, Paragraph 4.a-c]`.
*   **Injunctive Relief:** An order voiding, enjoining, or setting aside the conflicting interest transactions engaged in by the Individual Defendants `[claim.pdf, Page 99, Paragraph 9.a]`.

*   **Attorney Fees and Costs:** Recovery of all attorney fees and costs incurred in the prosecution of this action `[claim.pdf, Pages 95-100]`.

The complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains through its Unjust Enrichment claim `[claim.pdf, Page 91, Paragraphs 370-377]` and Conversion claim `[claim.pdf, Page 89, Paragraphs 357-363]`, which may be excluded from the policy's definition of 'Loss'.
