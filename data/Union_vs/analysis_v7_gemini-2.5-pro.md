## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

> A. With the **Insured Person** that if a **Claim** for a **Wrongful Act** is first made against any **Insured Person** during the **Policy Period** and reported in accordance with SECTION V. – CONDITIONS, C. Notice of **Claim** or Circumstance of this policy, the **Insurer** will pay on behalf of such **Insured Person** all **Loss** such **Insured Person** is legally obligated to pay, except and to the extent that the **Insured Organization** is required or permitted to indemnify such **Insured Persons**.
> 
> B. With the **Insured Organization** that if a **Claim** for a **Wrongful Act** is first made against any **Insured Person** during the **Policy Period** and reported in accordance with SECTION V. – CONDITIONS, C. Notice of **Claim** or Circumstance of this policy, the **Insurer** will pay on behalf of the **Insured Organization** all **Loss** for which the **Insured Organization** is required or permitted to indemnify the **Insured Person**.
> 
> C. With the **Insured Organization** that if a **Claim** for a **Wrongful Act** is first made against the **Insured Organization** during the **Policy Period** and reported in accordance with SECTION V. – CONDITIONS, C. Notice of **Claim** or Circumstance of this policy, the **Insurer** will pay on behalf of the **Insured Organization** all **Loss** the **Insured Organization** is legally obligated to pay. `[policy.pdf, Page 25, Section I, Clause A-C]`

In the absence of a clear indication that the **Insured Organization** is unable or unwilling to indemnify the **Insured Persons**, the initial analysis proceeds under **Insuring Agreement** B for claims against individuals and **Insuring Agreement** C for claims against the entity.

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The submitted Third Amended Complaint satisfies the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The policy defines **Claim** as, inter alia, "A civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or arbitration proceeding for monetary or non-monetary relief which is commenced by... [r]eceipt or service of a complaint or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section III, Clause B.2.a]`. The Third Amended Complaint is a civil proceeding commenced by service of a complaint seeking monetary and non-monetary relief `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Title]`, `[claim.pdf, Pages 95-100, PRAYER FOR RELIEF]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the claim document partially qualify as insureds. The **Insured Organization** named in the policy is The Union Square Owner's Association `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 1]`. The lawsuit names Union Square Owners Association, Inc. as a defendant, which is an **Insured Organization** `[claim.pdf, Page 2]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section III, Clause H.1]`. The policy defines **Insured Person** as "any past, present or future director, officer, trustee, **Employee**, or any committee member of a duly constituted committee of the **Insured Organization**" `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section III, Clause I]`. The complaint alleges that the following individual defendants served in such capacities: Kenneth Abdalla (past Management Committee member and president), Kay “Kitty” Stoneburner (past Management and Shared Interest Committee member), Cory Abdalla (past Management and Commercial Interest Committee member), John Sears (past Management Committee member), David Arms (past Management and Shared Interest Committee member), Jim Mikula (past Management Committee member), Paul Benson (past Management Committee member), and Nicholas F. Klein (past Management Committee member) `[claim.pdf, Pages 6-10, Numbers 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]`. These individuals appear to qualify as **Insured Persons**. One defendant entity, Malibu Property Management, LC, may qualify as an **Insured Organization** under the Coverage Extension – Property Managers endorsement `[policy.pdf, Page 7, Clause 1.a]`. The other entity defendants (e.g., Malibu Companies, LLC, Argentum Sky, LLC, etc.) do not appear to meet the definition of an **Insured**.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The claim alleges numerous **Wrongful Acts**. The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as "any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty... by... [a]n **Insured Person** while acting in his or her capacity as such... or... [t]he **Insured Organization**" `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section III, Clause O]`. The Complaint's Seventh Claim for Relief alleges that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Association through acts such as failing to govern in the Association's best interest, adopting improper budgets, failing to maintain the property, and depleting reserve funds, all while acting as committee members and officers `[claim.pdf, Pages 81-84, Numbers 336-343]`. These allegations constitute **Wrongful Acts** as defined.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was properly reported under the terms of the policy. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The policy covers **Claims** first made during the **Policy Period** from November 27, 2016, to November 27, 2017 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, ITEM 2]`. The **Claim** was first made on November 28, 2016, and reported on the same day, which falls within the **Policy Period**. A condition precedent to coverage is that notice of a **Claim** be given "as soon as practicable after such **Claim** is first made, but in no event shall such notice be given later than sixty (60) days after either the expiration date or any earlier cancellation date of this policy" `[policy.pdf, Page 30, Section V, Clause C.1]`.

In conclusion, the matter constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against **Insureds** under the policy and was timely made and reported. Therefore, the Insuring Agreements are triggered, subject to the remaining terms, conditions, and exclusions of the policy.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The policy defines **Loss** as "damages (including back pay and front pay), settlements, judgments (including pre- and post-judgment interest on a covered judgment) and **Defense Expenses**" `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section III, Clause K]`. The definition explicitly excludes several categories of damages, including but not limited to:

*   "Civil or criminal fines or penalties" `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section III, Clause K.6]`
*   "Taxes, whether owed to or by any **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section III, Clause K.7]`
*   "Matters that may be uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this policy shall be construed" `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section III, Clause K.9]`

The plaintiffs seek various forms of relief, including compensatory damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, punitive damages, attorney fees, and costs `[claim.pdf, Pages 95-100, PRAYER FOR RELIEF]`. The prayer for relief also includes a demand for an order voiding or setting aside conflicting interest transactions and other non-monetary relief `[claim.pdf, Page 99, Number 9.a]`.

Compensatory damages, interest, and **Defense Expenses** generally fall within the definition of **Loss**. The policy also provides that **Loss** includes punitive damages if insurable by law `[policy.pdf, Page 27, Section III, Clause K]`. The claim's demand for "punitive damages" `[claim.pdf, Page 98, Numbers 7.e, 8.e]` would therefore be covered only to the extent such damages are insurable under applicable law. The Twelfth Claim for Relief for Unjust Enrichment seeks disgorgement of benefits inequitably retained `[claim.pdf, Pages 91-92, Numbers 370-377]`, which may be considered restitutionary and therefore may not constitute "damages" within the definition of **Loss**. Similarly, claims seeking the return of misappropriated funds, such as the Tenth Claim for Relief for Conversion `[claim.pdf, Pages 89-90, Numbers 357-363]`, may be deemed uninsurable as a matter of law or excluded from the definition of **Loss**. A reservation of rights is warranted regarding whether all damages sought by the plaintiffs constitute covered **Loss**.

### 3. Related Claims

There are no explicit references to potentially earlier "**Related Claims**" that would trigger the Claim Interrelation Clause `[policy.pdf, Page 30, Section V, Clause B.3]`. However, the Complaint refers to a prior lawsuit, *Argentum Special Holdings, LLC et al. v. Union Square Owner’s Association, et al. (Case No. 140500083)* `[claim.pdf, Page 61, Number 245]`. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this or any other prior matter could be deemed a **Related Claim** under the policy.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

#### Applicable or Potentially Applicable Exclusions

*   **Prior Acts Exclusion (Added by Endorsement RSG 206069 1009):** This exclusion is applicable. The endorsement provides that the **Insurer** is not liable for **Loss** in connection with any **Claim** that "alleges, arises out of, is based upon or attributable to, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, any actual or alleged **Wrongful Acts** which first occurred prior to November 27, 2014" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, N/A]`. The Complaint alleges a continuous course of conduct and specific **Wrongful Acts** occurring both before and after this date. For example, it alleges that Kenneth Abdalla gained control of various committees and commenced his scheme in 2012 `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Numbers 48-50]`, and that the Commercial Unit Directors were not qualified to serve beginning in late 2013 `[claim.pdf, Page 36, Number 132]`. The exclusion would bar coverage for any **Loss** arising from **Wrongful Acts** that first occurred prior to November 27, 2014.

*   **Prior and/or Pending Litigation Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement RSG 206071 0204):** This exclusion is potentially applicable. The policy, as amended, excludes **Loss** from any **Claim** "[a]lleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, in whole or in part, any litigation involving any **Insured** that was commenced or initiated prior to, or pending as of November 27, 2014, or arising out of or based upon, in whole or in part, any facts or circumstances underlying or alleged in any such prior or pending litigation" `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause 10]`. The Complaint references a prior lawsuit, Case No. 140500083, which was filed in 2014 `[claim.pdf, Page 61, Number 245]`. Further investigation is required to determine the subject matter of that litigation and whether the current **Claim** arises from the same or related facts.

*   **Personal Profit Exclusion:** This exclusion is potentially applicable, subject to final adjudication. The policy excludes **Loss** "[b]ased upon, arising out of or attributable to the gaining by any **Insured** of any profit or advantage to which such **Insured** was not legally entitled" `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section IV, Clause 1]`. The Complaint is replete with allegations that the defendants, particularly Kenneth Abdalla, misappropriated funds and structured transactions for their personal enrichment `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 4]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 64, Number 261]`. The exclusion is conditioned upon "a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section IV, Clause 1]`. Therefore, a reservation of rights is appropriate.

*   **Fraud/Criminal Act Exclusion:** This exclusion is potentially applicable, subject to final adjudication. The policy excludes **Loss** "[b]ased upon, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from or in consequence of, or in any way involving any criminal or deliberate fraudulent act" `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section IV, Clause 2]`. The Complaint alleges an "intentional scheme to enrich Kenneth Abdalla" and the "theft and misuse of millions of dollars" `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 3]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 4]`, which could be construed as deliberate fraudulent acts. This exclusion is also subject to "a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to any **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section IV, Clause 2]` and warrants a reservation of rights.

*   **Contractual Liability Exclusion:** This exclusion is partially applicable. It bars coverage for **Loss** from a **Claim** "[a]lleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, in whole or in part, any liability under or pursuant to any contract or agreement" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 11]`. The First, Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth claims for relief allege breach of contract or breach of covenants `[claim.pdf, Pages 67, 69, 71, 76, 79, 90, 92]`. These claims appear to fall within the scope of this exclusion. The exclusion does not apply to liability an **Insured** would have in the absence of the contract, such as common law fiduciary duties. The analysis of this exclusion's application to each cause of action requires further factual development.

*   **Specific Exclusion - Lien Disputes (Added by Endorsement RSG 206080 0204):** This exclusion is potentially applicable. The endorsement bars coverage for **Loss** arising from any **Claim** relating to "any lien disputes, or 'super lien' disputes or foreclosures of any sort" `[policy.pdf, Page 14, N/A]`. The complaint alleges that the Association pursued nonjudicial foreclosure of units `[claim.pdf, Page 51, Number 206]`, and that as part of the scheme, the Association would demand payment from owners with the "threat of foreclosure" `[claim.pdf, Page 40, Number 154]`. To the extent **Loss** arises from these specific allegations, this exclusion may apply.

*   **Builder/Developer Exclusion (Added by Endorsement RSG 206051 1214):** This exclusion is applicable. It bars coverage for **Loss** from any **Claim** alleging a dispute with a "converter, builder, developer or contractor" `[policy.pdf, Page 10, N/A]`. The Complaint alleges Kenneth Abdalla engaged in a scheme with the "goal of eventually converting the Sky Lodge to whole ownership condominiums" `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 3]`. To the extent Kenneth Abdalla is deemed a "converter" or "developer" in relation to these alleged activities, this exclusion would bar coverage for claims arising therefrom.

*   **Insured vs. Insured Exclusion:** This exclusion is partially applicable. It bars coverage for **Claims** "[b]rought by or on behalf of any **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 7]`. The Union Square Owners Association, Inc. is an **Insured Organization** and is a plaintiff (acting through its Receiver). Therefore, the claims brought by the Association against the **Insured Persons** and Malibu PM (if deemed an **Insured**) would be barred, subject to any exceptions. An exception exists for "[a] derivative action brought by or made on behalf of, or in the name or right of, the **Insured Organization**, if such action is brought and maintained independently of, and without assistance, participation or intervention of any **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 7.a]`. The claim was initially brought derivatively `[claim.pdf, Page 59, Number 239]` but is now being pursued directly by the court-appointed Receiver on behalf of the Association `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Number 2]`. A further exception permits claims brought by a "receiver" of the **Insured Organization** `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 7.c]`. The claims brought by the Receiver on behalf of the Association against other **Insureds** appear to fall within this carve-out, restoring coverage.

#### Non-Applicable Exclusions

*   **Amended Bodily Injury and Property Damage Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement RSG 216014 0609):** This exclusion is not applicable. It relates to bodily injury and tangible property damage, which are not alleged in the **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section IV, Clause 3]`.
*   **ERISA/Labor Law Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. It precludes coverage for violations of various employment and benefits laws like ERISA and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which are not at issue `[policy.pdf, Page 28, Section IV, Clause 4]`.
*   **Workers' Compensation Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. It bars coverage for obligations under workers' compensation or similar laws `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 5]`.
*   **Pollution Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. No allegations of pollution are made `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 6]`.
*   **Prior Notice Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. There is no information to suggest that notice of this matter was given to a prior insurer `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 8]`.
*   **Professional Services Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Wrongful Acts** do not arise from the performance of professional services for a fee `[policy.pdf, Page 29, Section IV, Clause 9]`.
*   **Exclusion – Employment Practices Claim (Added by Endorsement RSG 206057 0808):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not allege any **Employment Practices Wrongful Act** `[policy.pdf, Page 11, N/A]`.
*   **Nuclear Energy Liability Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve nuclear energy `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section 1]`.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause:** This clause is applicable. The provision requires the **Insured** and **Insurer** to use their best efforts to allocate payments between covered and non-covered **Loss**, parties, and matters `[policy.pdf, Page 31, Section V, Clause F]`. Given that the **Claim** involves both potentially covered parties (the Association, its directors and officers) and non-covered parties (various Abdalla entities that are not **Insureds**), as well as potentially covered and non-covered causes of action (e.g., breach of fiduciary duty vs. breach of contract), allocation will be necessary.
*   **Defense and Settlement Clause (Amended by Endorsement RSG 204160 1210):** This clause is applicable. The **Insurer** has the right and duty to defend and appoint counsel `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section V, Clause A]`. The **Insured** cannot incur **Defense Expenses** or settle any **Claim** without the **Insurer's** prior written consent. If the **Insured** refuses a settlement recommended by the **Insurer**, the **Insurer's** liability is capped at the proposed settlement amount plus 80% of covered **Loss** exceeding that amount `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section V, Clause A.1-2]`.
*   **Other Insurance Clause:** This clause is applicable. This policy applies as excess over any other valid and collectible insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 31, Section V, Clause E]`. Investigation is required to determine if any other policies may provide coverage for the defendants.
*   **Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause:** This clause is not currently relevant, as no acquired or created subsidiaries are identified as defendants, but its provisions would govern if any such entities were implicated `[policy.pdf, Page 32, Section V, Clause I]`.
# Conclusion

Based on the foregoing analysis, there is **potential coverage** for the **Claim**. The Third Amended Complaint alleges a covered **Claim** for **Wrongful Acts** against parties who qualify as **Insureds** under the policy, and the **Claim** was made and reported in a timely fashion. This potential for coverage triggers the **Insurer's** duty to defend under the policy, as amended by endorsement RSG 204160 1210 `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section V, Clause A]`.

However, significant coverage issues exist which mandate that the defense be provided under a full reservation of rights. Key issues include: (i) the Prior Acts exclusion, which may bar coverage for **Loss** arising from any alleged misconduct that first occurred before November 27, 2014; (ii) the potential applicability of the Prior and/or Pending Litigation, Builder/Developer, and Specific Lien Disputes exclusions; (iii) the application of the Contractual Liability exclusion to several causes of action; (iv) the Insured vs. Insured exclusion, though likely overcome by the carve-out for claims brought by a receiver; and (v) the definition of **Loss**, which may not encompass all relief sought, such as disgorgement or restitution. The coverage position is preliminary and subject to revision as factual investigation proceeds.
