## Frank D. Tsuru and Stephanie K. Tsuru v. Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. and Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C.
### Submission Summary
This summary delineates a claim for damages arising from alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and other wrongful acts, brought forth by claimants Frank D. Tsuru and Stephanie K. Tsuru. The claim, initiated on 10/01/2010, was formally presented in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. and Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
The parties against whom the claim is asserted are exclusively corporate entities, identified as follows:
- **Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C.** (Insured Company) `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 2]`
- **Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C.** (Insured Company) `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 3]`

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegations constituting the alleged Wrongful Acts are that the Defendants, in their capacity as investment advisers, committed material breaches of their professional and fiduciary obligations. Specifically, it is alleged that the Defendants, without the Plaintiffs' informed consent, unilaterally invested the entirety of the Plaintiffs' approximate $10 million in capital—characterized as their "nest egg"—into a single class of high-risk, illiquid instruments known as Auction Rate Preferred Securities (ARPS) `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 6]`. This action directly contravened the agreed-upon Investment Policy Statement which mandated a "conservative" risk profile with a primary objective of capital preservation through "prudent diversification" `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraph 14]`. The Defendants are further accused of material misrepresentation by characterizing said ARPS as safe and liquid "cash equivalents" `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Paragraph 33]`, while failing to disclose or heed significant warnings of illiquidity and market failure contained within the securities' own prospectuses `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 31]`. The Defendants subsequently failed to monitor the investments or timely advise the Plaintiffs of the catastrophic collapse of the ARPS market `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Paragraph 43]`.

### Relief Sought
The Plaintiffs seek substantial legal and equitable remedies. The primary relief sought is the **full rescission** of all ARPS transactions, restoring the Plaintiffs to their original liquid position `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph B]`. In addition, the following forms of relief are explicitly requested:
- **Monetary Damages:** Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages for lost opportunity costs, any loss of principal on the original funds, and any interest charges incurred from borrowing against the devalued securities `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Paragraph 11]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 32, Paragraphs 82, 83]`.
- **Disgorgement/Restitution:** Plaintiffs seek disgorgement of fees paid for the Defendants' investment advisory services `[claim.pdf, Page 28, Paragraph 70]`.
- **Punitive Damages:** Plaintiffs explicitly demand punitive damages, alleging the Defendants' conduct was willful, wanton, and reckless. The amount sought is specified as at least three times in excess of $7 million `[claim.pdf, Page 34, Paragraph D]`.
- **Prejudgment Interest:** A claim is made for prejudgment interest on all damages at the statutory rate `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph B]`.
- **Attorneys' Fees and Costs:** Recovery of all reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees, expert fees, and forum costs is sought pursuant to various Texas statutes `[claim.pdf, Page 34, Paragraphs E, F, G, H]`.

### Counts
- **Count 1 - Negligence:** The Defendants negligently breached their duties by recommending unsuitable investments and failing to disclose material risks `[claim.pdf, Page 23, Paragraph 53]`. 
- **Count 2 - Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** The Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by concentrating all assets in a single risky class and failing to monitor the accounts `[claim.pdf, Page 25, Paragraph 59]`.
- **Count 3 - Breach of Contract:** The Defendants breached their contractual obligation to manage and monitor the Plaintiffs' accounts with competence and care `[claim.pdf, Page 26, Paragraph 63]`.
- **Count 4 - Violations of the Texas Securities Act:** The Defendants sold securities by means of untrue statements and material omissions regarding the liquidity and value of the ARPS `[claim.pdf, Page 27, Paragraph 65]`.
- **Count 5 - Civil Liability of Investment Adviser and Investment Adviser Representatives:** The Defendants engaged in fraudulent practices and made material omissions in violation of their duties as investment advisers `[claim.pdf, Page 28, Paragraph 68]`.
- **Count 6 - Negligent Supervision:** The Defendants failed to implement and enforce reasonable supervisory policies over their brokers and advisers `[claim.pdf, Page 29, Paragraph 72]`.
- **Count 7 - Violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act:** The Defendants made false representations about the characteristics and quality of their investment services and the recommended securities `[claim.pdf, Page 30, Paragraph 75]`.
- **Count 8 - Claims:** The Defendants violated various NASD Rules, NYSE Rules, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 through their actions `[claim.pdf, Page 31, Paragraph 78]`.

### References to Related Claims
The claim document makes explicit reference to other legal actions, which could bear upon a "Related Claims" analysis. The Defendants allegedly provided Mr. Tsuru with copies of lawsuits and arbitrations filed by other plaintiffs against ARPS issuers or auction agents, thereby acknowledging contemporaneous litigation concerning the same class of securities `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Paragraph 50]`. Additionally, the complaint references a well-publicized 2006 S.E.C. enforcement action that censured 15 major broker-dealers for their sales practices related to Auction Rate Securities, an event the Defendants should have been aware of prior to their actions `[claim.pdf, Page 17, Paragraph 36]`.
