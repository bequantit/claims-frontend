## Frank D. Tsuru and Stephanie K. Tsuru v. Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. and Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C.
### Submission Summary
This submission, memorializing a claim created on 10/01/2010, constitutes a third-party claim brought by Frank D. Tsuru and Stephanie K. Tsuru against Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. and Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C. The complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Heading]`. The claim alleges that the Defendants, acting as investment advisers, breached their duties by investing the Plaintiffs' entire $10 million fund into illiquid and unsuitable Auction Rate Preferred Securities, resulting in substantial financial harm.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
The parties against whom the claim is made are corporate entities, identified as follows:
*   **Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C.** (“PFP”), identified as a parent company with subsidiary offices in Dallas, Texas `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 2]`.
*   **Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C.** (“PWM”), identified as a registered investment adviser and a subsidiary of PFP, also with an office in Dallas, Texas `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 3]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegations constituting a Wrongful Act under the policy are predicated upon the Defendants' breach of professional and fiduciary duties. Specifically, the Plaintiffs allege the Defendants committed the following acts and omissions:
*   **Unauthorized and Unsuitable Investment:** The Defendants unilaterally and without the Plaintiffs' knowledge invested approximately $10 million, constituting substantially all of the Plaintiffs' liquid net worth, into a single asset class, Auction-Rate Preferred Securities (`ARPS`) `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 6]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Paragraph 25]`.
*   **Breach of Investment Mandate:** This investment strategy directly contravened the agreed-upon Investment Policy Statement, which mandated a “conservative” risk profile with the primary goal to “...earn a positive real return on their assets while minimizing the overall risk of the portfolio through prudent diversification” `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraph 14]`.
*   **Misrepresentation and Omission:** The Defendants allegedly misrepresented ARPS as safe, highly liquid “cash equivalents” comparable to money market funds but with a higher yield `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Paragraph 33]`, while failing to disclose the material risks of illiquidity and potential for auction failure. These risks were explicitly detailed in the securities' prospectuses, which the Defendants either failed to read or consciously disregarded `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 31]`.
*   **Failure to Monitor and Advise:** Defendants failed to monitor market conditions, including known auction failures in the summer of 2007 `[claim.pdf, Page 18, Paragraph 37]`, and failed to timely inform the Plaintiffs of the market collapse in February 2008, preventing any timely mitigation of damages `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Paragraph 43]`.
*   **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** The Defendants are alleged to have breached their fiduciary duties by, inter alia, failing to manage the account in a manner consistent with the clients' objectives, failing to keep the clients informed of material market changes, and concentrating 100% of the portfolio in a single, unsuitable asset class `[claim.pdf, Page 25, Paragraph 60]` `[claim.pdf, Page 26, Paragraph 62]`.

### Relief Sought
The Plaintiffs seek an array of legal and equitable remedies, including:
*   **Rescission:** Full rescission of all ARPS transactions, restoring Plaintiffs to their original liquid position `[claim.pdf, Page 32, Paragraph 81]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph B]`.
*   **Compensatory Damages:** Recovery of all losses resulting from the Defendants' conduct, including any loss of principal, lost value from the forced sale of other assets, and interest charges incurred to borrow against the illiquid ARPS `[claim.pdf, Page 32, Paragraphs 82, 83]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph 84]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph C]`.
*   **Disgorgement:** Disgorgement of any advisory fees paid by Plaintiffs to the Defendants `[claim.pdf, Page 28, Paragraph 70]`.
*   **Interest:** Prejudgment interest on all damages at the statutory rate `[claim.pdf, Page 32, Paragraph 81]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph B]`.
*   **Punitive Damages:** An award of punitive or exemplary damages in an amount of at least three times in excess of $7 million, premised on the alleged willful, wanton, and reckless nature of the Defendants' conduct `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph 86]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 34, Paragraph D]`.
*   **Attorneys' Fees and Costs:** Recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and other costs pursuant to various Texas statutes `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Paragraph 85]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 34, Paragraphs E, F, G, H]`.

### References to Related Claims
The claim document makes reference to other legal proceedings and regulatory actions, which may be pertinent to a “Related Claims” analysis under the policy:
*   The claim notes that in 2006, the S.E.C. censured 15 major broker-dealers for their practices related to the sale and auction of Auction Rate Securities, an action which the Defendants should have been aware of `[claim.pdf, Page 17, Paragraph 36]`.
*   The Defendants allegedly sent Mr. Tsuru copies of lawsuits, including class-action cases and arbitrations, filed by other plaintiffs against issuers or auction agents concerning ARPS, suggesting this was a potential course of action for the Plaintiffs against third parties `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Paragraph 50]`.
