## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The Investment Adviser Professional Liability Coverage Part contains a single insuring agreement. There are no distinct Side A, B, or C insuring agreements as typically found in a Directors and Officers Liability policy. The insuring agreement states:

>The **Insurer** shall pay on behalf of the **Insured** that **Loss** resulting from any **Claim** first made against the **Insured** during the **Policy Period** or Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, for a **Wrongful Act**. `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section I]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The submitted complaint appears to satisfy the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The policy defines **Claim** as, inter alia, "a civil proceeding in a court of law or equity or an arbitration" `[policy.pdf, Page 4, Section II]`. The matter at hand is a civil proceeding initiated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, styled as Frank D. Tsuru and Stephanie K. Tsuru v. Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. and Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C., Civil Action No. 3:10-cv-02321-L `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`. This constitutes a **Claim** under the policy.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants fully qualify as **Insureds** under the policy. The **Named Insured** is Presidio Wealth Management LLC `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 1]`. The defendants named in the lawsuit are Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C. (“PWM”) and Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. (“PFP”) `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 2-3]`. The policy's **Insured Entity** is defined as the **Investment Adviser** `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section II]`, which in turn is defined as the **Named Insured** and any **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section II]`. PWM, as the **Named Insured**, qualifies as an **Insured Entity**. Furthermore, the Vicarious Liability Coverage For Scheduled Entities With Codefendant Endorsement (GSL20595XX) extends **Insured** status to Presidio Financial Partners LLC, but solely to the extent a covered **Claim** is made against it for a **Wrongful Act** of an Entity (PWM), provided both are named as co-defendants `[policy.pdf, Page 45, Section A, B]`. As both PWM and PFP are named co-defendants in the Tsuru complaint `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, PFP qualifies as an **Insured** under this endorsement.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The complaint alleges multiple **Wrongful Acts**. The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as "any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect or breach of duty committed or attempted by an **Insured** in rendering, or failing to render, **Professional Services**" `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section II]`. **Professional Services**, as amended by endorsement GSL8471XX, means "giving financial, economic or investment advice regarding investments in securities to a customer or client, including investment management services, pursuant to a contract defining the consideration for and the scope of such advise or services" `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section II]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section 1]`. The complaint alleges numerous failures in the provision of such services, including, inter alia, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and misrepresentations in connection with the investment of the Plaintiffs' funds in Auction Rate Preferred Securities (`ARPS`) `[claim.pdf, Pages 23-26, Number 53-62]`. These allegations fall squarely within the definition of a **Wrongful Act**.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was timely made and reported. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The **Policy Period** is from July 1, 2010, to July 1, 2011 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 2]`. The **Claim** was first made on October 1, 2010, which is within the **Policy Period**. A **Claim** is deemed made in the case of a civil proceeding on the date of service of a complaint `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section V, Clause 3.b]`. The lawsuit was filed on November 15, 2010, and we assume service occurred on or after that date, within the **Policy Period**. The **Claim** was reported to the **Insurer** on October 3, 2010. The policy requires notice of a **Claim** be given "as soon as practicable... but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the end of the **Policy Period**," as amended by endorsement GSL10006XX `[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section V, Clause 1]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 22, Section 1]`. The reporting on October 3, 2010, satisfies this provision.

Based on the foregoing, the **Claim** satisfies all requirements of the insuring agreement, thereby triggering the policy.
## Conclusion

Based on the analysis hereinabove, there is **potential coverage** for the **Claim** asserted by the Tsurus against Presidio Wealth Management LLC and Presidio Financial Partners LLC. The **Claim** meets the policy's definition thereof, the defendants are considered **Insureds**, the allegations constitute a **Wrongful Act**, and the **Claim** was made and reported in a timely manner. Consequently, the **Insurer**'s duty to pay **Loss**, including the advancement of **Defense Costs** in excess of the Retention, is triggered, subject to the terms and conditions of the Policy.

This preliminary coverage position is subject to a reservation of rights. Specifically, rights are reserved concerning the applicability of the Illegal Profits/Deliberate Acts exclusion pending final adjudication, the allocation of any portion of a potential settlement or judgment that may be deemed uninsurable as restitution or disgorgement of fees under the definition of **Loss**, and the application of other policy exclusions as facts are developed through discovery. Further investigation is warranted to fully ascertain the applicability of these and other policy provisions. Therefore, a defense will be afforded under a complete reservation of rights.
