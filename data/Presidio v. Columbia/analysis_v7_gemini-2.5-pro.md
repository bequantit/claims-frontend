## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The policy provides three Insuring Agreements. Based on the claim details, Insuring Agreement B is the most likely to be triggered initially, as it pertains to loss for which the **Insured Entity** indemnifies an **Insured Person**. Should the **Insured Entity** be unable or not permitted to indemnify the **Insured Persons**, Insuring Agreement A could apply. Insuring Agreement C applies to **Securities Claims** against the **Insured Entity**. Given the nature of the allegations involving the sale of securities and the potential for a **Securities Claim** as defined, this insuring agreement is also potentially triggered. The Insuring Agreements, as stated in the policy, are:

> I. INSURING AGREEMENTS
> A. The Insurer shall pay on behalf of any **Insured Person** the **Loss** for which the **Insured Person** is not indemnified by the **Insured Entity** arising from a **Claim** first made against such **Insured Person** during the **Policy Period** or the Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, for a **Wrongful Act**.
> B. The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Entity** the **Loss** for which the **Insured Entity** has, to the extent permitted or required by law, indemnified an **Insured Person**, arising from a **Claim** first made against such **Insured Person** during the **Policy Period** or the Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, for a **Wrongful Act**.
> C. The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the **Insured Entity**, the **Loss** arising from a **Securities Claim** first made against the **Insured Entity** during the **Policy Period** or the Extended Reporting Period, if applicable, for a **Wrongful Act**. `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section I]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The lawsuit satisfies the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The policy defines **Claim** as, inter alia, "a civil proceeding commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section II, Clause C(1)]`. The matter at hand is a civil lawsuit initiated with the filing of a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Title]`, seeking monetary damages and other relief `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Relief Requested]`. This directly meets the definition of a **Claim**. The claim also qualifies as a **Securities Claim** as it is brought by a purchaser of securities of the **Insured Entity** (Auction Rate Preferred Securities) relating to the purchase of such securities `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Number 11]`. The definition of a **Securities Claim** is "a **Claim**, other than an administrative or regulatory proceeding, made against any **Insured**...alleging a violation of any state, federal or common law regulating securities" `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section II, Clause DD]`. The complaint alleges violations of the Texas Securities Act `[claim.pdf, Page 27, Count 4]`, thereby satisfying this definition.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the complaint partially qualify as insureds under the policy. The **Named Insured** is Presidio Wealth Management LLC `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Declarations]`. The defendants in the lawsuit are Presidio Wealth Management, L.L.C. ("PWM") and Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. ("PFP") `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Parties]`. The policy defines **Insured Entity** as the **Named Insured** and any **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause P]`. PWM, as the **Named Insured**, is an **Insured Entity**. The complaint alleges PFP is the parent company of PWM `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Number 3]`. The policy does not explicitly include parent companies in the definition of **Insured Entity**. Therefore, coverage for PFP is questionable and requires further investigation into the corporate structure and whether it could be considered a **Named Insured** by other means. The complaint also names individuals Colin Carter, Jerry Deren, Julie Kathleen Helwig, and a Managing Director named Cobb `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 15 & Page 22, Number 48]`. The policy defines **Insured Person** as "any past, present or future...director, officer, [or] employee...of the **Insured Entity**" `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause Q]`. As employees of PWM, these individuals would qualify as **Insured Persons**.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The complaint alleges a **Wrongful Act**. The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as "any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, or breach of duty...by an **Insured Person** in his or her capacity as such, or...by the **Insured Entity**" `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section II, Clause MM]`. The complaint alleges numerous such acts, including negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, making untrue statements and material omissions regarding the nature and risks of ARPS, and concentrating 100% of the plaintiffs' assets into an unsuitable asset class `[claim.pdf, Page 24, Number 57; Page 25, Number 60]`. These allegations fall squarely within the definition of a **Wrongful Act**.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The claim was properly reported under the policy's terms. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The claim was first made on October 1, 2010, and reported to the Insurer on October 3, 2010. The policy requires that notice be given "as soon as practicable" after a **Claim** is first made `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section V, Clause A]`. Reporting the **Claim** two days after it was made satisfies this requirement.

In conclusion, the matter constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against **Insureds** (at least PWM and its employees) and was timely reported. Therefore, the Insuring Agreements are triggered, subject to the policy's other terms, conditions, and exclusions.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The damages sought in the complaint must constitute **Loss** as defined by the policy for coverage to apply. The policy defines **Loss** as:

> ...damages, judgments..., settlements or **Defense Costs** which any **Insured** shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a **Claim** to which this Policy applies... **Loss** shall not include: (1) civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed by law; (2) punitive or exemplary damages...; (3) the multiplied portion of any multiplied damage award; (4) taxes; (5) any amount for which the **Insureds** are not financially liable or which are without legal recourse to the **Insureds**; (6) any amounts which are uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Policy shall be construed... `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause R]`

The complaint seeks various forms of relief, including compensatory damages, rescission of the securities purchase, prejudgment interest, attorneys' fees, and punitive damages `[claim.pdf, Pages 33-34, Relief Requested]`. The compensatory damages, interest, and **Defense Costs** would generally fall within the definition of **Loss**. However, the policy explicitly excludes punitive damages, which the plaintiffs seek in an amount of at least three times in excess of $7 million `[claim.pdf, Page 34, Number D]`, from the definition of **Loss** `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause R(2)]`. The claim for rescission `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Number B]` may also be deemed uninsurable as it represents a disgorgement of funds received, rather than damages, and could be interpreted as an amount for which the **Insureds** are not financially liable under item (5) of the **Loss** definition. At this preliminary stage, a reservation of rights is necessary regarding the portions of the demanded relief that may not constitute covered **Loss**, particularly with respect to punitive damages and rescissionary relief.

### 3. Related Claims

There are no explicit references in the complaint to any prior claims or proceedings that would constitute **Related Claims** under the policy. The complaint details communications between the parties prior to the filing of the lawsuit `[claim.pdf, Pages 21-23, Numbers 44-52]`, but these do not appear to rise to the level of a **Claim** as defined in the policy.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following policy exclusions have been analyzed for their applicability to the instant **Claim**.

**Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **IV.A. Conduct:** This exclusion is applicable, subject to a final adjudication. It precludes coverage for any **Claim** "brought about or contributed to by any dishonest, fraudulent or criminal act or omission or any willful violation of any statute, rule or law by any **Insured**" `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section IV, Clause A]`. The complaint alleges willful and reckless violations of statutes, including the Texas Securities Act and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act `[claim.pdf, Page 27, Count 4; Page 30, Count 7]`, and seeks punitive damages for willful, wanton, and reckless conduct `[claim.pdf, Page 33, Number 86]`. However, this exclusion applies only after a "final adjudication" establishes such conduct. Therefore, a defense will be afforded under a full reservation of rights pending the outcome of the litigation.

*   **IV.B. Personal Profit:** This exclusion is applicable, subject to a final adjudication. It precludes coverage for any **Claim** "based upon or arising out of any **Insured** gaining in fact any personal profit or advantage to which such **Insured** was not legally entitled" `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section IV, Clause B]`. The complaint alleges the defendants earned fees by inappropriately placing funds into certain investments `[claim.pdf, Page 26, Number 61]`. This exclusion is also triggered only upon a "final adjudication," and a defense will be afforded under a reservation of rights.

*   **IV.J. Professional Services:** This exclusion is applicable. It precludes coverage for any **Claim** "alleging, based upon, arising out of, or attributable to the rendering of or failure to render any professional services" `[policy.pdf, Page 17, Section IV, Clause J]`. The complaint is centered on allegations of improper investment advice, portfolio management, failure to disclose risks, and unsuitable investment selection, all of which constitute professional services provided by the **Insureds** in their capacity as wealth managers and investment advisers `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Number 16; Page 24, Number 56]`. However, the policy contains an E&O Buyback Endorsement that deletes this exclusion and replaces it with a new Insuring Agreement for Professional Liability. As the endorsement document is not provided, the effect of this buyback cannot be fully assessed, but the underlying conduct falls within this exclusion's scope.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **IV.C. Prior Notice:** This exclusion is not applicable. There is no indication that any notice has been given under any prior policy concerning this **Claim** or its subject matter.

*   **IV.D. Prior/Pending Litigation:** This exclusion is not applicable. The policy's Prior & Pending Litigation Date is 09/27/2007 `[policy.pdf, Page 2, Declarations]`. The wrongful acts alleged in the complaint, specifically the investment in ARPS, occurred in September 2007 `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Number 25]`, and the subsequent market collapse and failure to act occurred thereafter, all on or after the Prior & Pending Litigation Date. Therefore, this exclusion does not apply.

*   **IV.E. Insured v. Insured:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** is brought by clients of the **Insured Entity**, Frank and Stephanie Tsuru, not by another **Insured**.

*   **IV.F. Bodily Injury/Property Damage:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** alleges **Financial Loss**, not **Bodily Injury** or **Property Damage**.

*   **IV.G. ERISA:** This exclusion is not applicable. The allegations do not pertain to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

*   **IV.H. Fees:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** seeks damages and rescission, not the return of professional fees, although it does allege fees were improperly earned `[claim.pdf, Page 26, Number 61]`.

*   **IV.I. Contractual Liability:** This exclusion is not applicable. While a breach of contract is alleged `[claim.pdf, Page 26, Count 3]`, the exclusion contains a carve-back stating it does not apply to "liability which would have attached to the **Insureds** in the absence of such contract or agreement" `[policy.pdf, Page 17, Section IV, Clause I]`. The core allegations of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty exist independently of any contract.

*   **Endorsement No. 22 - Pollution Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve any allegations related to **Pollutants** or environmental damage `[policy.pdf, Page 42, Endorsement 22]`.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Defense and Settlement Clause:** This clause is applicable. The Insurer has the right to associate in the defense and settlement of any **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section V, Clause B]`. The **Insureds** are prohibited from settling any **Claim**, incurring **Defense Costs**, or admitting liability without the Insurer's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld `[policy.pdf, Page 18, Section V, Clause B]`. This provision is critical for managing the litigation and associated costs.

*   **Allocation Clause:** This clause is applicable. The policy provides that if a **Claim** involves both covered and uncovered matters, there shall be a fair and proper allocation between covered and non-covered **Loss** `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section V, Clause C]`. Given the potential for uncovered damages (punitive damages, rescission) and potentially uncovered parties (PFP), this clause will be relevant.

*   **Other Insurance Clause:** This clause may become applicable. It states that this policy's coverage is excess over any other existing valid and collectible insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 19, Section V, Clause E]`. It will be necessary to determine if the **Insureds** have any other potentially applicable insurance, such as a professional liability policy.

## Conclusion

Based on the foregoing analysis, there is a clear potential for coverage under the policy. The complaint constitutes a **Claim** alleging **Wrongful Acts** by **Insureds** that was timely reported under the terms of the policy, thus triggering the Insurer's duty to defend. The defendants Presidio Wealth Management LLC and its employees, Colin Carter, Jerry Deren, Julie Kathleen Helwig, and Cobb, qualify as **Insureds**. The status of Presidio Financial Partners, L.L.C. as an **Insured** is uncertain and requires further investigation into the corporate relationship with the **Named Insured**.

A defense should be provided to the insured parties, but under a full and complete reservation of rights. This reservation is necessitated by several factors. First, a significant portion of the damages sought, specifically punitive damages, are expressly excluded from the definition of **Loss**. Furthermore, the demand for rescission may also constitute an uninsurable disgorgement of funds. Second, the Conduct and Personal Profit exclusions, while not immediately applicable, may preclude indemnity coverage pending a final, adverse adjudication against the **Insureds**. Finally, the Professional Services exclusion appears to apply to the substance of the allegations, and its effect must be clarified by reviewing the E&O Buyback Endorsement, which was not provided. The potential for uncovered parties and damages also mandates the application of the policy's Allocation clause.
