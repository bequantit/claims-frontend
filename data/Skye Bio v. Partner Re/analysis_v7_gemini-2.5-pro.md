*   **The definition of "Claim":** The lawsuit satisfies the definition of a **Claim**.

    The First Amended Complaint constitutes a civil proceeding initiated against the defendants for monetary damages and other relief `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Section FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT]` and therefore satisfies the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The definition of **Claim**, as modified by the MARSH AMENDATORY ENDORSEMENT, is, in pertinent part:
    > any written demand for monetary damages, non monetary relief, injunctive relief or other relief against any of the **Insureds**, or any civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory, arbitration or mediation proceeding or other alternative dispute resolution process initiated against any of the **Insureds**... `[policy.pdf, Page 44, Section 2, Clause B.1]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the **Claim** qualify as **Insureds**.

    The **Parent Company** named in the policy is Nemus Bioscience, Inc `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section Item A]`. The **Claim** alleges that Defendant SKYE BIOSCIENCE, INC. was formerly known as Nemus Bioscience, Inc `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Number 2]`. Therefore, SKYE BIOSCIENCE, INC. qualifies as the **Company** under the policy `[policy.pdf, Page 16, Section II, Clause T]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section II, Clause C.1]`. The First Amended Complaint also names EMERALD HEALTH SCIENCES, INC. as a defendant `[claim.pdf, Page 15]`, alleging it was the majority shareholder and parent company of Skye `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Number 4]`. The policy defines **Subsidiary** as an entity over which the **Parent Company** has **Management Control** `[policy.pdf, Page 17, Section II, Clause AA]`, not the other way around. However, EMERALD HEALTH SCIENCES, INC. may qualify as an **Insured** if it meets the joint-employer or integrated enterprise allegations in the complaint `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Number 7]`, which requires further factual development. The **Claim** is brought by a former employee, Wendy Cunning, who alleges she was hired as Vice President of Business Operations `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 13]`. While she is the plaintiff, the **Wrongful Acts** at issue involve her supervisor, CEO Dr. Brian Murphy `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 13]`. As the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Murphy qualifies as an **Insured Person** under the Policy, which defines **Insured Persons** to include "all persons who were, now are, or shall be directors, officers or risk managers of the **Company**..." `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section II, Clause K.1]`. The **Claim** is brought against the **Company** itself, which is an **Insured** `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause L]`. The Plaintiff alleges that she reported her concerns to the **Company's** CEO and Chief Financial Officer `[claim.pdf, Page 23, Number 43]`. As an officer, the CFO would also be considered an **Insured Person** `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section II, Clause K.1]`.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The **Claim** alleges **Wrongful Acts** by **Insureds**.

    The **Claim** alleges, inter alia, that the **Company's** CEO intentionally issued a misleading press release to inflate the company's stock price, provided insider information to a shareholder, and made other misrepresentations to investors `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Number 18]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 25, 26]`. These allegations constitute alleged acts, errors, omissions, or misstatements by an **Insured Person** (Dr. Murphy) acting in his capacity as CEO. The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as:
    > any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty:
    > 1. by any of the **Insured Persons**, while acting in their capacity as such, or any matter claimed against any of the **Insured Persons** solely by reason of their serving in such capacity... `[policy.pdf, Page 17, Section II, Clause BB.1]`.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** was first made and reported during the **Policy Period**.

    For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage. The **Policy Period** is from December 31, 2018, to January 31, 2020 `[policy.pdf, Page 5, Section Item B]`. The **Claim** was first made on November 21, 2021, which is after the **Policy Period**. However, the **Claim** alleges that the Plaintiff filed a complaint with OSHA on January 3, 2020 `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 9]`. The policy states a **Claim** includes "any proceeding before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any similar federal, state, local or foreign governmental body" `[policy.pdf, Page 44, Section 2, Clause B.1.(b)]`. An OSHA filing concerning Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower violations qualifies as such a proceeding. This proceeding was initiated on January 3, 2020, which is within the **Policy Period**. The lawsuit filed on November 21, 2021, arises from the same facts and circumstances as the OSHA complaint. The policy provides that all **Claims** arising from **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** are deemed a single **Claim** made at the time the first such **Claim** was made `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause C]`. Therefore, the **Claim** is deemed first made on January 3, 2020. Assuming the **Claim** was reported to Underwriters as soon as practicable and no later than sixty (60) days after the end of the **Policy Period** (by March 31, 2020) `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section VI, Clause A.1]`, the reporting requirement is met.

Based upon the foregoing, the matter appears to satisfy the requirements of the insuring agreements, subject to confirmation of the notice date. The **Claim** is a civil proceeding alleging **Wrongful Acts** by **Insureds** and is deemed to have been first made during the **Policy Period**.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The **Claim** seeks damages which appear to fall, at least in part, within the policy's definition of **Loss**. The policy defines **Loss**, in pertinent part, as:
> (a) damages, judgments, including pre and post-judgment interest, and settlements,
> 
> (b) **Inquiry Costs** and **Costs, Charges and Expenses**, and
> 
> (c) punitive, exemplary or multiplied damages where the applicable law allows coverage for punitive, exemplary or multiplied damages,
> 
> incurred by any of the **Insureds**... `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause O.1]`.

The Plaintiff seeks various forms of damages, including back pay, front pay, emotional distress damages, reputational damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and a civil penalty `[claim.pdf, Pages 25-26, Section WHEREFORE]`. **Costs, Charges and Expenses** are covered as part of **Loss**. The claims for back pay and front pay may be considered uncovered to the extent they are for wages or salary owed, as the definition of **Loss** excludes "any wages, salary or benefits owed pursuant to the terms of any employment contract" `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section II, Clause O.iv]`. The claim for a civil penalty of $10,000 under Labor Code §1102.5 `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Number 4]` may be excluded under the provision that disallows coverage for "criminal or civil fines or penalties imposed by law" `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section II, Clause O.ii]`, although an exception exists for certain civil penalties under Insuring Clause I.A., subject to a sublimit `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section II, Clause O.ii.c]`. The claim for punitive damages `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Number 49]` would be covered only if permissible under applicable law `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause O.1.(c)]`. At this preliminary stage, a reservation of rights is necessary regarding the extent to which the claimed damages constitute covered **Loss**.

### 3. Related Claims

There are no explicit references in the provided documentation to previously reported **Claims**, **Investigations**, or circumstances that would constitute **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** under the policy and trigger the Claim Interrelation Clause `[policy.pdf, Page 21, Section IV, Clause C]`. The OSHA filing on January 3, 2020 `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 9]` and the instant lawsuit are considered part of the same single **Claim**.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following policy exclusions are analyzed for their applicability to the **Claim**:

**Applicable Exclusions (or Potentially Applicable Pending Adjudication)**

*   **Exclusion E (Insured vs. Insured):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** is brought by a former employee against the **Company** and is not a **Claim** by, on behalf of, or at the direction of the **Company** itself `[claim.pdf, Page 15]`. This exclusion, as modified by the MARSH AMENDATORY ENDORSEMENT `[policy.pdf, Page 49, Section 3, Clause E]`, does not apply.

*   **Exclusion F (Conduct):** This exclusion is potentially applicable, subject to a final adjudication. As modified by the MARSH AMENDATORY ENDORSEMENT `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section 4, Clause F]`, this exclusion precludes coverage for **Loss** in connection with a **Claim** brought about or contributed to by (1) any deliberately fraudulent or deliberately criminal act or omission by any of the **Insureds**, or (2) any personal profit or financial advantage gained to which they were not legally entitled. The Plaintiff's allegations include that Dr. Murphy issued a fraudulent press release `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Number 19]` and engaged in acts to further his personal interests `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Number 30]`. However, the exclusion applies only after a "final non-appealable adjudication adverse to the relevant **Insureds**". Therefore, defense will be afforded under a reservation of rights pending such an adjudication.

*   **Exclusion G (Illegal Remuneration):** This exclusion is potentially applicable, subject to a final adjudication. As modified by the MARSH AMENDATORY ENDORSEMENT `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section 4, Clause G]`, it precludes coverage for the return of remuneration paid without the approval of the governing body if found to be in violation of law by a final, non-appealable adjudication. The **Claim** does not currently seek such relief, but its applicability will be reserved.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions**

*   **Exclusion A (Bodily Injury/Property Damage):** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **Exclusion B (Prior Notice/Pending & Prior Litigation):** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **Exclusion C (Pollution):** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **Exclusion D (ERISA/FLSA):** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **Exclusion H (Corporate Takeover):** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **Nuclear Incident Exclusion Clause:** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **Radioactive Contamination Exclusion Clause:** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **War and Terrorism Exclusion Endorsement:** This exclusion is not applicable.

*   **Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause:** This exclusion is not applicable.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause:** This clause is applicable `[policy.pdf, Page 30, Section XIII]`. Given that some portions of the claimed damages may not constitute covered **Loss** (e.g., wages, certain penalties), an allocation of any judgment or settlement between covered and uncovered loss may be necessary. Underwriters and the **Insureds** are to use best efforts to agree upon a fair and reasonable allocation.

*   **Defense and Settlement Clause:** This clause is applicable `[policy.pdf, Page 23, Section V]`. The **Insureds** have the duty to defend, and Underwriters' consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, is required before incurring **Costs, Charges and Expenses** or entering into any settlement.

*   **Other Insurance Clause:** This clause is applicable `[policy.pdf, Page 52, Section 6]`. It provides that the policy is excess over other valid and collectible insurance, unless such other insurance is written as specific excess to this policy.

*   **Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause:** This clause may be relevant `[policy.pdf, Page 17, Section II, Clause AA]`, `[policy.pdf, Page 26, Section VIII, Clause B.1]`. As the **Claim** alleges a complex corporate history with name changes and a potential parent company defendant (Emerald Health Sciences, Inc.), this clause will be relevant to confirming the scope of the entities covered as the **Company**.
## Conclusion

Based upon this preliminary analysis of the submitted documentation, there is potential for coverage under the policy. The matter constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** by **Insureds**, which is deemed to have been first made within the **Policy Period**. Consequently, a duty to advance **Costs, Charges and Expenses**, subject to the applicable Retention and all policy terms, is triggered under Insuring Clause I.B.

However, this position is subject to a full reservation of rights. Significant coverage issues require further investigation and may preclude indemnity for all or part of any ultimate **Loss**. These issues include, but are not limited to, the determination of which damages constitute covered **Loss**, the applicability of the Conduct exclusion (Exclusion F) pending a final adjudication, and the allocation of **Loss** between covered and uncovered matters. Accordingly, we will issue a reservation of rights letter to the **Insureds** acknowledging the potential for coverage while outlining the policy provisions that may limit or preclude coverage as the matter develops.
