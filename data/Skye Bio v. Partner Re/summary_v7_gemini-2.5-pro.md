### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
The parties against whom the claim is made are as follows:
*   **SKYE BIOSCIENCE, INC.**, a Nevada Corporation, identified as the insured company and Plaintiff's employer `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Paragraph 2]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The primary allegation is that the Defendants effectuated a retaliatory termination of the Plaintiff, their former Vice President of Business Operations, for engaging in protected activity under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and California Labor Code `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Paragraph 38]`. The alleged Wrongful Acts forming the basis of Plaintiff's protected complaints include, inter alia:
*   The intentional issuance of a misleading press release by the CEO, Dr. Brian Murphy, on March 12, 2019, which overstated the efficacy of a therapeutic study to deceive investors and inflate the company's stock price, allegedly constituting securities fraud `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Paragraph 23]`.
*   The dissemination of "grossly inaccurate market sizing analyses" to investors and the board of directors `[claim.pdf, Page 20, Paragraph 30]`.
*   Engaging in conduct Plaintiff reasonably believed constituted insider trading, wherein the CEO provided non-public, material information to a key shareholder `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Paragraph 31]`, and subsequently attempted to use his position to acquire company assets for a competitor `[claim.pdf, Page 21, Paragraph 34]`.
*   Plaintiff alleges she was marginalized and ultimately terminated on July 18, 2019, as a direct consequence of her protests against these purported unlawful acts `[claim.pdf, Page 22, Paragraph 38]`.

### Relief Sought
The Plaintiff seeks a judgment awarding all relief necessary to make her whole, including:
*   **Monetary Damages:** Comprising back pay with interest, front pay, lost salary, bonuses, benefits, and compensation for lost equity grants `[claim.pdf, Page 23, Paragraph 46]` and `[claim.pdf, Page 25, Paragraphs A.1, A.2]`.
*   **Non-Pecuniary Damages:** Including damages for emotional distress, anxiety, humiliation, and reputational harm `[claim.pdf, Page 25, Paragraphs 53, A.3]` and `[claim.pdf, Page 26, Paragraph A.5]`.
*   **Statutory Penalties:** A civil penalty of $10,000 for each violation under California Labor Code ยง1102.5, a form of relief which may be excluded from the policy's definition of "Loss" `[claim.pdf, Page 25, Paragraph A.4]`.
*   **Punitive Damages:** Plaintiff seeks punitive and exemplary damages, alleging Defendants acted with malice, fraud, and oppression. Such damages are typically excluded from the definition of "Loss" under a standard D&O policy `[claim.pdf, Page 25, Paragraph 54]`.
*   **Other Relief:** Litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees `[claim.pdf, Page 26, Paragraph A.6]`.

### References to Related Claims
The claim document explicitly references a prior administrative action which is a prerequisite to the instant litigation. Specifically, Plaintiff states she timely filed a complaint on January 3, 2020, with the United States Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning the same subject matter and alleging violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act `[claim.pdf, Page 17, Paragraph 14]`. This prior administrative filing constitutes a demand that may trigger notice obligations and could be deemed a Related Claim under the policy.
