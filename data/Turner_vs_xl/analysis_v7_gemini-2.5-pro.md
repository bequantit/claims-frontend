## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

> (C) The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the Company Loss resulting from a Securities Claim for a Wrongful Act of an Insured Person. 
[policy.pdf, Page 9, Section I]

* **The definition of "Claim"**: The Claim does constitute a "Claim" as defined by the policy. The definition of **Claim** in the policy includes "a written demand for monetary damages or non-monetary relief" and "a civil proceeding in a court of law" `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section II, Clause E. (1) and (2)]`. The Petition is a civil proceeding initiated in the District Court of Oklahoma County. `[claim.pdf, Page 2]`

* **Insured Status of Named Parties**:  The insured entity is American Energy Partners, LP `[policy.pdf, Page 2, Item 1]`. The defendants named are SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC, SCOOP Energy Company, LLC, Thomas J. Blalock (in his capacity as Personal Representative of the ESTATE OF AUBREY K. MCCLENDON and individually), and Ryan A. Turner `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Heading]`. The policy defines **Insured Person** as "any past, present or future director, officer, member of the Board of Managers or Management Committee member of the Company." `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section II, Clause M]`. The Claim alleges that Thomas J. Blalock and Ryan A. Turner were part of the "Executive Management Team" of American Energy Partners, LP (AELP) `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Section 9]` and were involved in the management of SCOOP Holdings and SEC `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Section 15(b)]`. Scott R. Mueller is also described as part of the Executive Management Team and as the CFO of AELP and SCOOP Holdings and SEC. `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Section 9; Page 6, Section 19 & 23]`.  Based on their roles, it is likely that Thomas J. Blalock and Ryan A. Turner would qualify as **Insured Persons**.  However, further information regarding their specific titles and roles within the corporate structure of AELP, SCOOP Holdings, and SEC would be necessary to confirm their status. SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC and SCOOP Energy Company, LLC may qualify as **Insureds** under the definition of **Subsidiary** if they were controlled by American Energy Partners, LP `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section II, Clause Y]`. The claim states that SCOOP Holdings is a holding company that owns all of the membership interests in SEC. `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Section 3]` and that the estate of Aubrey K. McClendon is the majority owner of SCOOP Holdings `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Section 2]`. This suggests they may not qualify as subsidiaries under the policy definition which requires more than 50% ownership by the parent company. Further investigation into the corporate structure is required. The estate of Aubrey K. McClendon is not an insured entity. The named defendants in the claim may be partially considered insureds pending further information.

* **Wrongful Act**: The claim alleges a **Wrongful Act** as defined by the policy. The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as "any actual or alleged breach of duty, neglect, error, misstatement, misleading statement, omission or other act by the **Insured Person** in their capacity as such" `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section II, Clause DD]`. The claim alleges a breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty by the defendants, which would fall under this definition. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants, in their capacity as management, failed to honor the terms of the Equity and Co-Investment Agreement (ECOIA) regarding profit sharing `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Count II]`. The claim also alleges a resulting trust due to the defendants' actions `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Count III]`. These allegations constitute a **Wrongful Act** under the policy.

* **Claims Made and Reported Analysis**:  The claim was made on November 1, 2016, and received on September 2, 2016. The policy period is from August 27, 2016, to February 27, 2017 `[policy.pdf, Page 2, Item 2]`. The claim was first made within the policy period. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage.

Based on the analysis of the insuring agreements, the claim appears to trigger the policy. The action is a civil proceeding which constitutes a **Claim** under the policy. The named defendants, Thomas J. Blalock and Ryan A. Turner, likely qualify as **Insured Persons**. The allegations of breach of contract and fiduciary duty constitute a **Wrongful Act**. The claim was made within the policy period. Therefore, there is a potential for coverage under the policy, specifically under Insuring Agreement B, as the company would be expected to indemnify its officers. 

### 2. “Loss” Analysis
The definition of **Loss** in the policy is: 
> "**Loss** means damages, judgments, settlements and **Defense Costs**. **Loss** shall not include: (1) fines or penalties imposed by law or the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award; (2) taxes; (3) any amount for which the **Insureds** are not financially liable or which are without legal recourse to the **Insureds**; (4) any amount incurred by the **Company** in connection with any **Claim** brought by an **Insured Person** to the extent that such amount represents the value of any stock or stock option award or other financial or performance-based incentive, or any perquisite or benefit, to which such **Insured Person** claims entitlement, or which is not insurable under the law of the jurisdiction most favorable to the insurability of such amount. However, this sub-paragraph (4) shall not apply to **Defense Costs** incurred in connection with such **Claim**; (5) matters which are uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Policy is construed."
[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section II, Clause N]

The plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment, damages for breach of contract, and the imposition of a resulting trust. Specifically, the plaintiff claims damages for his 6% interest in the profits from the SCOOP Assets sale, which he states 
## Conclusion 

Based upon the foregoing analysis, it is recommended that the Insurer acknowledge its obligations under the policy and issue a reservation of rights letter. There appears to be a potential for coverage under Insuring Agreement B of the policy. The submitted Petition constitutes a **Claim** for a purported **Wrongful Act** that was made and reported within the policy period. While the individual defendants, Thomas J. Blalock and Ryan A. Turner, appear to qualify as **Insured Persons**, further investigation is necessary to definitively confirm their status and the status of the corporate defendants, SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC and SCOOP Energy Company, LLC, as **Insureds** under the policy.

The primary coverage issue arises from the definition of **Loss** and its exclusion of amounts representing the value of financial or performance-based incentives. The core of the Plaintiff's claim is his entitlement to a share of profits from the SCOOP Assets sale, which likely falls within this exclusion. However, **Defense Costs** associated with this **Claim** are expressly not excluded. Additionally, several policy exclusions, particularly those related to prior or pending litigation, known circumstances, and contractual liability, may be applicable and should be further investigated. Therefore, a reservation of rights is warranted to allow for a more thorough investigation of the facts and the applicability of these policy provisions while providing a defense to the **Insureds** for the covered portion of the **Claim**.
