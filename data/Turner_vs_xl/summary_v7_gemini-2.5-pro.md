## Scott R. Mueller v. SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC, et al.
### Submission Summary
This submission, created on 09/01/2016, constitutes a third-party claim brought by Plaintiff Scott R. Mueller in the District Court of Oklahoma County, State of Oklahoma `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Case Caption]`. The claim is asserted against several entities and individuals, including SCOOP Energy Company Holdings, LLC, and seeks judicial determination and enforcement of alleged contractual rights to a share of profits from the sale of certain corporate assets.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
The following entities and individuals are named as Defendants in this action:
- **SCOOP ENERGY COMPANY HOLDINGS, LLC:** A Delaware limited liability company, identified as the insured entity `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 2]`.
- **SCOOP ENERGY COMPANY, LLC:** An Oklahoma limited liability company, wholly owned by SCOOP Holdings `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 3]`.
- **THOMAS J. BLALOCK, in his capacity as Personal Representative of the ESTATE OF AUBREY K. MCCLENDON:** The representative of the estate of the deceased majority owner of SCOOP Holdings `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 4]`.
- **THOMAS J. BLALOCK, individually:** An individual and member of the former Executive Management Team `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 5]`.
- **RYAN A. TURNER, individually:** An individual and member of the former Executive Management Team `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 6]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegation constitutes a failure to honor contractual and other agreements, which failure is asserted as a Wrongful Act. Plaintiff alleges that he, along with Defendants Blalock and Turner (collectively, the "Executive Management Team"), and the now-deceased Aubrey K. McClendon entered into an Equity and Co-Investment Agreement ("ECOIA") effective September 30, 2015 `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Paragraph 14]`. It is further alleged that this ECOIA, as supplemented by subsequent oral and written agreements, established a specific "Profit Sharing Ratio" for new business ventures, including Defendants SCOOP Holdings and SEC `[claim.pdf, Page 7-8, Paragraphs 25-27]`. Pursuant to these agreements, Plaintiff asserts entitlement to a six percent (6%) share of the profits attributable to Mr. McClendon's ninety-five percent (95%) membership interest in SCOOP Holdings following the sale of the SCOOP Assets `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Paragraph 26]`. The alleged Wrongful Act is the withholding of these funds and the failure of the Defendants, particularly the Personal Representative of the McClendon Estate, to cause the distribution of the Plaintiff's alleged share following the consummation of the asset sale, thereby effectuating a breach of the aforesaid agreements `[claim.pdf, Page 14-15, Paragraph 61]`.

### Relief Sought
The Plaintiff seeks several forms of relief from the Court, enumerated as follows:
- **Declaratory Judgment:** A judicial declaration establishing the contractual rights and duties of the parties, affirming that Plaintiff and the other members of the Executive Management Team own their respective profit shares, and that said shares do not constitute property of the McClendon Estate `[claim.pdf, Page 13, Paragraph 54]`. The Plaintiff also seeks a declaration to establish an employee bonus pool and authorization for Plaintiff, as the sole remaining officer of the SCOOP entities, to make distributions accordingly `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 55-56]`.
- **Monetary Damages for Breach of Contract:** Judgment for damages equivalent to the Plaintiff's six percent (6%) profit share, an amount alleged to exceed $75,000, together with pre- and post-judgment interest `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Paragraph 62]`.
- **Equitable Relief (Resulting Trust):** In the alternative, the imposition of a resulting trust over the proceeds from the sale of the SCOOP Assets for the benefit of the Executive Management Team `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Paragraphs 64, 67]`. The Plaintiff requests an order compelling the trustee to distribute the shares beneficially owned by the Plaintiff and other team members `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Paragraph 68]`.
- **Other Relief:** Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate `[claim.pdf, Page 16, Request for Relief (d)]`. The petition does not explicitly seek punitive damages, fines, or penalties, but requests distribution of funds which may be characterized as restitution.

### Counts
- **Count I - Declaratory Judgment:** Seeking a declaration of the contractual rights and ownership interests of the parties `[claim.pdf, Page 12, COUNT I]`.
- **Count II - Breach of Contract:** Alleging breach of the ECOIA and subsequent agreements for failure to distribute the Plaintiff's profit share `[claim.pdf, Page 14, COUNT II]`.
- **Count III - Resulting Trust:** Asserting in the alternative that the proceeds are held in a resulting trust for the benefit of the Plaintiff and the Executive Management Team `[claim.pdf, Page 15, COUNT III]`.

### References to Related Claims
The Petition makes explicit reference to a probate proceeding pending in Oklahoma County, styled _In The Matter of The Estate of Aubrey McClendon, Deceased_, Case No. PB-2016-342 `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 4]`. It is noted that an order from this probate court was required to approve the participation of the Personal Representative in the asset sale `[claim.pdf, Page 11, Paragraph 44]` and that objections by creditors in said probate proceeding are alleged to be the cause for blocking the distribution of profits `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraphs 45-46]`.
