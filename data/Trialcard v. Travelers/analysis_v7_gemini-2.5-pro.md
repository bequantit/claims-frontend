*   **The definition of "Claim":** The lawsuit satisfies the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The policy defines **Claim** as, inter alia, a civil proceeding against any **Insured** for a **Wrongful Act**, including any appeal therefrom, commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause C.1]`. The matter at hand is a civil proceeding commenced by the filing of a complaint against defendants, including Mayne Pharma, Inc. `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The complaint seeks monetary damages `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Number a]`, which also satisfies the definition of **Claim** `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause C.3]`.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants partially qualify as **Insureds**. The **Named Insured** is TC HOLDINGS, LLC `[policy.pdf, Page 8, Item 1]`. The defendants named in the complaint are Mayne Pharma, Inc., and John Does 1-10 `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The policy defines **Insured** to include the **Insured Organization** `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section II, Clause J.1]`. **Insured Organization** is defined as the **Named Insured** and any **Subsidiary** `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section II, Clause K]`. To confirm if Mayne Pharma, Inc. is an **Insured Organization**, information regarding its status as a **Subsidiary** of TC HOLDINGS, LLC as defined in the policy `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section II, Clause X]` is required.

# Conclusion

Based upon the foregoing analysis, there is potential for coverage under the Private Company Directors and Officers Liability Coverage Part of the policy for the **Claim** asserted against Mayne Pharma, Inc. The matter satisfies the definitions of **Claim** and **Wrongful Act**, and the **Claim** was timely made and reported. Consequently, the **Company** has a duty to provide coverage, subject to a comprehensive reservation of rights.

The initial coverage position is preliminary. A reservation of rights is warranted based upon several factors. First, confirmation of Mayne Pharma, Inc.'s status as an **Insured Organization** is required. Second, a significant portion of the damages sought by the Plaintiff, including statutory damages under the TCPA, may not constitute covered **Loss**. Third, and most critically, the Invasion of Privacy Exclusion `[policy.pdf, Page 17, Section IV, Clause D]` appears directly applicable to the core allegations of the complaint, which are founded upon violations of privacy rights through unsolicited faxes. Application of this exclusion could ultimately preclude coverage for this matter. Further investigation is necessary to fully ascertain the facts and confirm the applicability of all policy terms, conditions, and exclusions.
