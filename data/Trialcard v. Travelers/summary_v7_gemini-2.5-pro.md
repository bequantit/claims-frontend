## Glen Ellyn Pharmacy, Inc. v. Mayne Pharma, Inc.
### Submission Summary
This Submission Summary memorializes a purported class action complaint, which was created on 08/23/2019, filed by Plaintiff Glen Ellyn Pharmacy, Inc. (hereinafter "Claimant"), on behalf of itself and a proposed class, against Defendant Mayne Pharma, Inc. (hereinafter "the Insured"). The action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and alleges violations of federal and state statutes, as well as common law torts, arising from the alleged transmission of unsolicited facsimile advertisements. The Claimant seeks, inter alia, monetary damages, injunctive relief, and costs of suit.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)
The following entities are identified as defendants in the complaint:
- **Mayne Pharma, Inc.:** The corporate entity and insured, identified as a North Carolina corporation `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 4]`.
- **John Does 1-10:** Unidentified natural or artificial persons alleged to have been involved in the transmission of the facsimile advertisements at issue `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 5]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)
The central allegation constituting the alleged Wrongful Act is that the Insured engaged in a practice of sending, or causing to be sent, unsolicited advertisements to telephone facsimile machines `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 1]`. This course of conduct is alleged to be in direct violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. §227 (“TCPA”), the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act, 815 ILCS 505/2 ("ICFA"), and various common law duties `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 1]`. The complaint specifically pleads that the Claimant received at least one such unsolicited facsimile on or about June 16, 2016, and that said facsimile did not contain a legally compliant opt-out notice as mandated by federal statute `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 9]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 16]`. The Insured’s conduct is characterized as having been undertaken either negligently or willfully, thereby constituting a neglect, breach of duty, or violation of law `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 13]`.

### Relief Sought
The Claimant seeks the following forms of relief and remedies against the Insured:
- **Monetary Damages:** Claimant seeks actual damages for consumed supplies `[claim.pdf, Page 7, WHEREFORE a]`, statutory damages under the TCPA of $500 per violation `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 23]`, and other unspecified “appropriate damages” for the common law and ICFA counts `[claim.pdf, Page 9, WHEREFORE a]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 12, WHEREFORE a]`.
- **Enhanced Damages:** The complaint requests that the Court, in its discretion, award treble damages for any willful or knowing violations of the TCPA `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 23]`. Such damages may be construed as punitive or exemplary damages, which could be excluded from the definition of Loss under the policy.
- **Injunctive Relief:** Claimant seeks an injunction to prohibit the Insured from transmitting further unsolicited facsimile advertisements `[claim.pdf, Page 7, WHEREFORE c]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 9, WHEREFORE b]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 12, WHEREFORE b]`.
- **Attorneys’ Fees and Costs:** Claimant requests an award of attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs of suit, particularly under the ICFA count `[claim.pdf, Page 9, WHEREFORE c]`.
- **Restitution/Disgorgement:** While not explicitly pleaded as such, the conversion claim seeks damages for the value of paper and toner appropriated by the Insured, which is tantamount to a demand for restitution `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Paragraph 53]`. The statutory damages sought under the TCPA may be characterized as a penalty and thus could fall outside the definition of Loss.

### Counts
- **Count I:** Defendant violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending unsolicited advertisements via facsimile `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 22]`.
- **Count II:** Defendant committed unfair acts and practices in violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act (ICFA) `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 37]`.
- **Count III:** Defendant committed the tort of conversion by appropriating the Claimant's paper and ink or toner for its own use `[claim.pdf, Page 10, Paragraph 53]`.
- **Count IV:** Defendant's transmission of unsolicited faxes constituted an unreasonable invasion of property and a private nuisance `[claim.pdf, Page 12, Paragraph 67]`.
- **Count V:** Defendant's unauthorized use of Claimant's facsimile equipment constituted a trespass to chattels `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 81]`.

### References to Related Claims
A thorough review of the provided complaint reveals no explicit references to previously filed claims, prior litigation, formal demands, or governmental investigations involving the same or substantially similar subject matter or parties. However, the nature of the allegations as a class action `[claim.pdf, Page 5, Paragraph 28]` and the assertion that the facsimile at issue was part of a "mass broadcasting" `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 15]` suggest the potential for other, unmentioned claims to exist or arise from the same alleged course of conduct, which may trigger a Related Claims analysis under the policy.
