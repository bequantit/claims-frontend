## Policy Summary

This analysis pertains to the Directors and Officers (D&O) Liability Insurance Policy issued by Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, bearing Policy Number 10029402-01 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Policy Number]`. The policy provides an Aggregate Limit of Liability of $13,000,000 for each **Policy Year** `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 3]`.

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Insuring Agreement Analysis

The Insurer's obligations are delineated as follows:
> A. The Insurer will pay on behalf of the **Insured Persons**, **Loss** in excess of the applicable **Retention** resulting from **Claims** first made during the **Policy Period** against the **Insured Persons** for which the **Insured Persons** are legally obligated to pay for **Wrongful Acts**, except for **Loss** which the **Company** pays as indemnification. `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section I, Clause A]`
> B. The Insurer will pay on behalf of the **Company**, **Loss** in excess of the applicable **Retention** resulting from **Claims** first made during the **Policy Period** against the **Insured Persons** for which the **Company** has agreed to or is legally permitted or required by law to indemnify the **Insured Persons** for **Wrongful Acts**. `[policy.pdf, Page 10, Section I, Clause B]`

In addition, Endorsement 6195 provides entity coverage:
> The Insurer will pay on behalf of the **Company**, **Loss** in excess of the applicable **Retention** resulting from **Claims** first made during the **Policy Period** against the **Company** for which the **Company** is legally obligated to pay for **Wrongful Acts**. `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section I]`

*   **The definition of "Claim":** The submitted lawsuit appears to satisfy the policy's definition of a **Claim**. The policy, as modified by Endorsement 3660, defines a **Claim** as, inter alia, "a civil proceeding commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading" `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause B(2)]`. The matter at hand is a civil action initiated by the filing of a Complaint in the Superior Court of Rhode Island `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. This falls squarely within the policy's definition of a **Claim**.

*   **Insured Status of Named Parties:** The named defendants in the **Claim** qualify as insureds. The **Named Insured** is Bancorp Rhode Island, Inc. and several other listed entities, including Bank Rhode Island `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 1(a)]`. The defendants named in the Complaint are Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. d/b/a BankRI, Bernard LaBush, and Stevan H. LaBush `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The policy defines the **Company** to include the first named entity, Bancorp Rhode Island, Inc. `[policy.pdf, Page 11, Section III, Clause C]`. Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. is a named defendant and is therefore an insured entity under the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement `[policy.pdf, Page 35, Section I]`. The Complaint also names Bernard LaBush and Stevan H. LaBush as defendants `[claim.pdf, Page 1]`. The Complaint alleges that Bernard and Stevan LaBush provided accounting services to the plaintiffs, EMC and Pietrantonio, and were not employees or officers of BankRI `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Number 11]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 9, Number 45]`. The definition of **Insured Person** means "any past, present or future director, trustee, officer, **Employee** or honorary and/or advisory director or trustee of the **Company**" `[policy.pdf, Page 50, Section III, Clause E]`. As Bernard and Stevan LaBush are not alleged to be directors, officers, or employees of the **Company**, they do not appear to qualify as **Insured Persons** under the policy. No coverage is afforded for the allegations against them.

*   **Wrongful Act:** The Complaint alleges **Wrongful Acts**. The policy defines **Wrongful Act** as "any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty by: (1) any **Insured Person** acting solely in the capacity as such" `[policy.pdf, Page 12, Section III, Clause L(1)]`. The Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement defines **Wrongful Act** with respect to the **Company** as "any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty by the **Company** or by any person or entity for which the **Company** is legally responsible" `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause L]`. The Complaint alleges numerous failures by BankRI, including breach of contract, negligence, and failure to exercise due care in handling EMC's accounts, which resulted in an embezzlement scheme `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, `[claim.pdf, Page 13, Number 71]`. These allegations constitute alleged errors, omissions, neglect, and breaches of duty, thereby satisfying the definition of **Wrongful Act**.

*   **Claims Made and Reported Analysis:** The **Claim** appears to have been timely made and reported. The **Claim** was made on 05/05/2008, which is within the **Policy Period** of 06/01/2005 to 06/01/2008 `[policy.pdf, Page 1, Item 2]`. The **Claim** was reported to the Insurer on 05/07/2008. As modified by Endorsement 4572, the policy requires notice of a **Claim** be given "as soon as practicable... but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the end of the **Policy Year** in which such **Claim** is made" `[policy.pdf, Page 60, Section VII, Clause A]`. Reporting two days after the **Claim** was made satisfies this provision. For avoidance of doubt, please verify the claims made date as well as the date the matter was reported for insurance coverage.

Based on the foregoing analysis, the matter constitutes a **Claim** for alleged **Wrongful Acts** against an insured entity, first made during the **Policy Period** and timely reported. Therefore, the Insuring Agreements of the policy are potentially triggered, specifically the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement.

### 2. “Loss” Analysis

The policy's definition of **Loss** is broad but contains material exceptions. As modified by Endorsement 6195 for the Entity Errors and Omissions coverage, **Loss** is defined as:
> any amount which the **Company** is legally obligated to pay for a **Claim**, including **Defense Costs**, damages, judgments, settlements, pre- and post-judgment interest, punitive or exemplary damages and the multiple portion of any multiplied damage award where insurable by law, except **Loss** shall not include:
> (1) criminal or civil fines or penalties imposed by law; or
> (2) taxes; or
> (3) any unpaid, unrecoverable or outstanding credit extended to any customer; or
> (4) matters which are uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this Endorsement shall be construed; or
> (5) other than **Defense Costs**, that portion of **Loss** that the **Company** is obligated to pay pursuant to any express oral or written contract or agreement existing prior to the date the **Claim** is made. `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause G]`

The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $2,000,000 for the failure of their business `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, recovery of over $500,000 in embezzled funds `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Number 1]`, declaratory relief that a $250,000 debt is void `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Number 3]`, and reasonable attorney's fees and costs `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Number 4]`. The damages sought appear to constitute **Loss** under the policy. However, several counts in the Complaint are for breach of written, oral, and implied-in-fact contracts `[claim.pdf, Page 11, COUNT I, COUNT II, COUNT III]`. The policy's definition of **Loss** under the Entity E&O Endorsement excludes amounts the **Company** is obligated to pay pursuant to a contract `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause G(5)]`. Therefore, to the extent damages are awarded for breach of contract, they may not constitute covered **Loss**. Furthermore, a portion of the damages relates to the $250,000 unauthorized line of credit `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Number 31]`, which could be construed as "unpaid, unrecoverable or outstanding credit extended to any customer" and thus excluded from the definition of **Loss** `[policy.pdf, Page 36, Section III, Clause G(3)]`. At this preliminary stage, the full scope of damages is not yet adjudicated, and a reservation of rights is warranted regarding whether all claimed damages will ultimately constitute covered **Loss**.

### 3. Related Claims

There is no explicit reference in the submitted Complaint to any prior litigation or notices that would constitute **Interrelated Wrongful Acts** or trigger the Claim Interrelation Clause `[policy.pdf, Page 15, Section V, Clause C]`.

### 4. Coverage Limitations and Exclusions

The following analysis pertains to the exclusions under the base D&O policy and the Entity Errors and Omissions Endorsement (Form 6195), as the **Claim** is against the **Company**. Exclusions from other endorsements not triggered by the facts of the **Claim** (e.g., SEC Entity Liability, Insurance Agent E&O) are not considered directly applicable to the analysis of coverage for this specific **Claim** against the bank entity for its banking services.

**Applicable or Potentially Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Fraud Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is potentially applicable. It precludes coverage for **Loss**, other than **Defense Costs**, in connection with a **Claim** involving a fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act `[policy.pdf, Page 37, Section IV, Clause D]`. The Complaint alleges intentional interference with advantageous relations `[claim.pdf, Page 14, COUNT VII]` and intentional infliction of emotional distress `[claim.pdf, Page 15, COUNT IX]`. Application of this exclusion is conditioned upon a "judgment or other final adjudication" establishing such conduct `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause D]`. The Insurer will reserve its rights with respect to the applicability of this exclusion pending final adjudication.

*   **Illegal Profit or Payment Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is potentially applicable. It precludes coverage for **Loss**, other than **Defense Costs**, where the **Company** gained a financial advantage to which it was not legally entitled `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause E(1)]`. The Complaint alleges unjust enrichment against BankRI `[claim.pdf, Page 15, COUNT X]`. Application of this exclusion is conditioned upon a "judgment or other final adjudication" `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause E(1)]`. The Insurer will reserve its rights with respect to the applicability of this exclusion pending final adjudication.

*   **Contractual Obligation Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is applicable. It precludes coverage for **Loss** in connection with any **Claim** arising out of or in any way involving the intentional breach in fact of any express oral or written contract `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause N]`. The Complaint explicitly pleads causes of action for Breach of Written Contract (Count I), Breach of Oral Contract (Count II), Breach of Implied-in-Fact Contract (Count III), and Breach of Contract by Estoppel (Count IV) `[claim.pdf, Pages 11-13]`. Coverage for liability arising from these counts is likely precluded.

*   **Legal Lending Limit Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is potentially applicable. It bars coverage for any **Claim** arising from an extension of credit in excess of the legal lending limit of the **Company** `[policy.pdf, Page 40, Section IV, Clause V]`. While the Complaint does not explicitly allege a violation of legal lending limits, it does concern unauthorized draws on a line of credit `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 23]`. Further factual development is required to assess the applicability of this exclusion, and rights will be reserved.

**Non-Applicable Exclusions:**

*   **Bodily Injury and Property Damage Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. While the **Claim** includes allegations of emotional distress, the exclusion carves out employment-related claims, which is not the context here. The primary allegations pertain to financial and economic loss, not bodily injury or property damage in the traditional sense `[policy.pdf, Page 37, Section IV, Clause A]`.
*   **Collusion Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** is brought by a customer, not a security holder `[policy.pdf, Page 13, Section IV, Clause B]`.
*   **Prior Notice Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. There is no indication that notice of this matter was given under a prior policy `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause H]`.
*   **Prior and Pending Litigation Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 4562):** This exclusion is not applicable. The Complaint does not appear to arise from litigation pending prior to the dates specified in the endorsement `[policy.pdf, Page 59, Section IV, Clause I]`.
*   **Short-Swing Profit Exclusion:** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve Section 16(b) violations `[policy.pdf, Page 14, Section IV, Clause J]`.
*   **Subsidiary Past Acts Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. The allegations pertain to the named **Company**, not a newly acquired **Subsidiary** for acts pre-acquisition `[policy.pdf, Page 38, Section IV, Clause K]`.
*   **Brokerage/Advisory Services Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195, Modified by Endorsement 6590):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** concerns commercial banking services, not investment banking services, which is the only service marked for exclusion `[policy.pdf, Page 65, Section IV, Clause L]`.
*   **Bonding Company Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** is not for the benefit of an insurance or bond carrier `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause M]`.
*   **ERISA Bankruptcy Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not arise from the **Company's** capacity as a fiduciary of an **Employee Benefit Plan** `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause O]`.
*   **Failure to Collect Contribution/Benefits Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not relate to an **Employee Benefit Plan** `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause P]`.
*   **Failure to Maintain Insurance Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not allege a failure to effect or maintain insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause Q]`.
*   **Insider Loan Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195, Deleted by Endorsement 4506):** This exclusion was deleted by Endorsement 4506 `[policy.pdf, Page 56]` and is therefore not considered.
*   **Insolvency Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195, Deleted by Endorsement 4506):** This exclusion was deleted by Endorsement 4506 `[policy.pdf, Page 53]` and is therefore not considered.
*   **Insurance Operations Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve services as an insurance agent or broker `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause T]`.
*   **Internet Services Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. While the unauthorized transfers were made via internet banking `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Number 26]`, the **Claim** does not arise from the **Company** *providing* internet or software development services to third parties, but rather from its own operational use of an internet banking platform `[policy.pdf, Page 39, Section IV, Clause U]`.
*   **Safe Deposit Box Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 6195):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve safe deposit operations `[policy.pdf, Page 40, Section IV, Clause W]`.
*   **Trust Operations Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 4475):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** relates to commercial checking and credit line accounts, not trust operations `[policy.pdf, Page 52]`.
*   **Pollution Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 4562):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** does not involve pollutants `[policy.pdf, Page 58, Section IV, Clause G]`.
*   **Insured vs. Insured Exclusion (Modified by Endorsement 4562):** This exclusion is not applicable. The **Claim** is brought by a third-party customer, not by or at the behest of an **Insured** `[policy.pdf, Page 58, Section IV, Clause F]`.
*   **Securities Liability Exclusion (Added by Endorsement 4506):** This exclusion is not applicable. This exclusion, added to the E&O Endorsement, pertains to claims involving securities *issued by the Company*. The present claim does not involve such securities `[policy.pdf, Page 55]`.

### 5. Other Relevant Policy Provisions

*   **Allocation Clause:** This clause is applicable. Section IX (B) of the Entity E&O Endorsement `[policy.pdf, Page 42, Section IX, Clause B]` governs allocation when a **Claim** involves both covered and uncovered matters. Given the applicability of the Contractual Obligation exclusion and the potential for certain damages to be excluded from the definition of **Loss**, allocation of **Defense Costs** and any ultimate settlement or judgment between covered and uncovered matters will be necessary. The policy requires the parties to use their best efforts to agree on an allocation and provides for binding arbitration if an agreement cannot be reached `[policy.pdf, Page 42, Section IX, Clause B(3)]`.

*   **Defense and Settlement Clause:** This clause is applicable. Section VI (A), as modified by the Rhode Island Amendatory Endorsement 5790D, stipulates there is no duty to defend and that counsel must be mutually agreed upon `[policy.pdf, Page 46, Section VI, Clause A]`. The Insurer's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, is required for settlement or to incur **Defense Costs** `[policy.pdf, Page 46, Section VI, Clause A]`.

*   **Other Insurance Clause:** This clause is applicable. The policy provides that its coverage is excess to other existing insurance `[policy.pdf, Page 20, Section IX, Clause J]`.

*   **Subsidiaries/Acquisitions Clause:** This clause, as modified by Endorsement 8039 `[policy.pdf, Page 43, Section VIII]`, is not immediately relevant as the defendants are the primary named insureds and the facts do not suggest a recent acquisition is at issue.

# Conclusion

Based upon this preliminary analysis, there is **potential coverage** for the **Claim** asserted against the insured entity, Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. The **Claim** was first made during the **Policy Period**, was timely reported, and alleges **Wrongful Acts** as defined under the Entity Errors and Omissions Liability Endorsement. A duty to advance **Defense Costs**, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, is therefore triggered. However, no coverage appears to be afforded for the claims against defendants Bernard LaBush and Stevan H. LaBush as they do not qualify as **Insured Persons**.

A reservation of rights is required. Significant coverage issues exist that may limit the Insurer's ultimate indemnity obligation. Specifically, the definition of **Loss** may exclude damages for breach of contract and damages related to the extension of credit. Furthermore, the Contractual Obligation exclusion appears to directly apply to several counts in the Complaint. The Fraud and Illegal Profit exclusions may also apply pending a final adjudication. The Insurer's coverage position is preliminary and subject to modification as additional facts are developed through discovery and litigation.
