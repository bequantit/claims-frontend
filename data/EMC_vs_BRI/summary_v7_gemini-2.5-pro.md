## Empire Merchandising Corp. and Joseph Pietrantonio v. Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc.
### Submission Summary

This claim, initiated on 05/05/2008 in the Superior Court for the State of Rhode Island, Providence, SC, is brought forth by the plaintiffs, Empire Merchandising Corp. and its principal, Joseph Pietrantonio `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Parties]`. The complaint alleges that mismanagement by defendant Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. and professional negligence by defendants Bernard and Stevan LaBush enabled a substantial embezzlement scheme perpetrated by a plaintiff's employee. The defendants' alleged failures are purported to have led to the embezzlement of over $500,000 and the subsequent failure of the plaintiffs' business, causing further damages in excess of $2,000,000 `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 1]`.

### Named Defendant(s)/Party(ies)

The defendants named in the instant action are as follows:

*   **Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc. d/b/a BankRI:** A state-chartered financial institution identified as the insured company against which the primary allegations of mismanagement are directed `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 5]`.
*   **Bernard LaBush:** A natural person and Certified Public Accountant, doing business as LaBush and Company `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 6]`.
*   **Stevan H. LaBush:** A natural person and agent, servant, or employee of Bernard LaBush's accounting practice `[claim.pdf, Page 2, Paragraph 7]`.

### Core Allegations/Alleged Wrongful Act(s)

The complaint alleges a series of Wrongful Acts, consisting of neglect, breach of duty, errors, and omissions committed by the defendants. The core allegations against the insured, Bankcorp Rhode Island, Inc., include, inter alia:

*   **Failure in Account Servicing:** Negligently servicing the plaintiffs' commercial accounts by failing to detect and report numerous indicia of fraudulent activity, including approximately 950 checks presented against insufficient funds, a sudden departure from a 32-year history of sound financial management, and irregular cash deposit practices by non-authorized personnel `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 20]`.
*   **Unauthorized Line of Credit Access:** Permitting an unauthorized employee of the plaintiff, Ms. Rhonda Hastings, to make draws totaling $250,000 from a commercial line of credit via internet banking, despite contractual stipulations that only plaintiff Joseph Pietrantonio was authorized to access said line of credit and that online access was never authorized `[claim.pdf, Page 3, Paragraph 14]` and `[claim.pdf, Page 6, Paragraphs 23, 26, 27]`.
*   **Failure to Take Corrective Action:** Subsequent to the discovery of the embezzlement, wrongfully refusing to forgive the $250,000 debt incurred through unauthorized access and refusing to release or subordinate its first-position lien on all of the plaintiff company's assets, thereby precluding the plaintiff from securing essential alternative financing `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraphs 31, 32, 35]`. This refusal was allegedly used as leverage to compel the plaintiff to execute a full release of all claims against BankRI `[claim.pdf, Page 8, Paragraph 37]`.

### Relief Sought

The plaintiffs demand judgment against the defendants for the following forms of relief:

*   **Monetary Damages:** An order for the defendants to pay such damages as the plaintiffs have sustained, which are enumerated as in excess of $500,000 related to the direct theft and over $2,000,000 for the failure of the business `[claim.pdf, Page 1, Paragraph 1]`, plus damages for severe emotional distress `[claim.pdf, Page 14, Paragraph 78]`. The complaint also seeks reimbursement for approximately $24,000 in overdraft fees `[claim.pdf, Page 4, Paragraph 20b]` and interest improperly charged `[claim.pdf, Page 7, Paragraph 33]`.
*   **Declaratory Judgment:** A declaration from the Court that the $250,000 debt on the line of credit, BankRI's attendant security interest, and Mr. Pietrantonio's personal guarantee are void and of no legal force or effect `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Demands 2, 3]`.
*   **Costs and Fees:** An order for defendants to pay the costs of the action and reasonable attorneys' fees `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Demand 4]`.
*   **Equitable Relief:** Such further relief as the Court deems equitable and just `[claim.pdf, Page 19, Demand 5]`.

No explicit demand for punitive or exemplary damages is made, though the claim for unjust enrichment `[claim.pdf, Page 15, Count X]` may implicate the restitution of ill-gotten gains, which can be excluded from the policy's definition of "Loss".
